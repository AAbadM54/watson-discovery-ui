  "text": "We stayed at Casa Soco with family and had a wonderful experience. The house is very clean and comfortable with lots of natural light and nicely decorated. We appreciated all the thoughtful details and amenities throughout the house. The location is great as well, down a quiet street but centrally located to all the great restaurants on 1st Street and the South Congress strip.",
