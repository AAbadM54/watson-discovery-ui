  "text": "I was going through a bad breakup and needed a place away from my house and my ex for a couple of weeks, and this treehouse apartment was perfect. I used to live in this neighborhood and it's still the best part of Austin, central to everything, walkable, close to coffee and restaurants but quiet at night.\r\n\r\nJulie knew about my situation and left me a really sweet card, and checked on me via email every once in a while to see how I was doing.\r\n\r\nThe bedroom was great, full kitchen was great, clawfoot tub in the bathroom was fantastic. I got a lot of reading and thinking done.\r\n\r\nHonestly I wouldn't mind actually living here permanently.",
