  "text": "I was looking for a nice place to stay, but found... friends! And a nice place to stay. Sommer and Daniel are two of the coolest people I've ever met! Both very friendly and welcoming, and both strive to make your experience in Austin unforgettable. I was a long-term guest, and I loved every day of my stay in Austin because of these two guys. \r\n\r\nThe house and the room were very clean, very welcoming, and very comfortable. I really felt like I was home! Sommer took a great care of the room and the house. My stay could not have been better, and it was pretty sad to have to leave. I will definitely stay in touch with Sommer and Daniel, and Sommer's place will definitely be my first pick next time I'm in Austin!\r\n\r\nAlso, I highly recommend taking advantage of the fitness perks :)",
