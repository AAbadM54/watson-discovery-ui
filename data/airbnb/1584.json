  "text": "Dallas' place was great. It was clean and had updated finishings. We had a group of 9 girls staying in his condo and surprisingly all 9 of us had room and were comfortable. The condo is a convenient 10 minute cab ride to downtown. There were plenty of bath towels and blankets for everyone. Dallas was friendly and helpful if we had any questions throughout our stay.",
