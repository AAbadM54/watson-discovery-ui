  "text": "We had a delightful stay with Pam and Harley. Pam gave us a first night to remember at the Hula Hut. When we decided to stay a couple of more days, it wasn't a problem at all. Pam had her advice and bikes ready for us. She even showed us around town in her free time. We miss Harley's cuddles and appetite. He made our experience complete. When we ever come back, we hope to stay with them again. We can recommend everybody to do the same!",
