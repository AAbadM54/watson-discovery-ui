  "text": "Excellent Location!  Cottage as described.  Quaint and rustic but has everything you need.   It really is a very quiet and secluded location in the heart of Austin.  Less than 1/4 mile from lake path, Deep Eddy and restaurants.  I commuted to downtown by bike or took the bus (4 line very easy!).  Jonathan was extremely accommodating, communicative and checked in on me frequently.   Appreciate the stay!  Keep Austin Weird!!",
