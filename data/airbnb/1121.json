  "text": "Robin and Mike were great hosts! Their space was super cute and the bed was super comfortable. Very peaceful neighborhood that is easy walking distance to all kinds of great food. Robin was kind enough to give us some great suggestions as there was a lot to choose from. Robin and Mike were quiet as church mice in the mornings which was wonderful given our late nights at Fantastic Fest. We would definitely stay here again if we come back to Austin.",
