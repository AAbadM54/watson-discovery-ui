  "text": "Tri is a very gracious, hospitable host who goes out of his way to make his guests feel at home -- for instance, I was late arriving from the airport and he waited for me despite his other commitments. In addition to being located very close to the UT Austin campus, Cozy Home... is set in a very beautiful part of Austin. You wake up in the morning to the sounds of birds chirping and the sight of lush greenery outside the room's windows (there are even bamboo thickets around). And Jonathan, Tri's housemate is a great conversationalist -- I am going to miss our discussions about entrepreneurship, education, etc. All in all, I had a great time. Thanks much Tri for providing me with a home in Austin.",
