  "text": "Our host, Linda, was very welcoming. Her home is in a very nice quiet neighborhood in Austin. It was very safe and accessible to everything we had planned to do while in town.  Linda was very friendly and went out of her way to be accommodating. Her home was clean and neat. She allowed us to use her kitchen as needed and told us to make ourselves at home which was nice. There was parking available for our rental car.\r\n Linda offered to make us breakfast each morning, but, unfortunately, we were on the go a lot and left her house by 9:30 or 10:00 each morning and she hadn't yet gotten up to make the breakfast. This wasn't a big deal at all though since we had some favorite restaurants in town that we wanted to hit!  All in all, this airbnb was a great first experience and I would definitely stay with Linda again if I ever get back to Austin.",
