  "text": "This was a fantastic place to stay - everything was true to the pictures. It had everything you could want - in addition to the upgraded kitchen, it had a dining room, two bedrooms, and a good sized bathroom. Checking in was no problem due to their keyless system, so our late arrival didn't disturb anyone. The house came supplied with even the little things, like an iron and ironing board and some toiletries. It was a short drive away from the University and night life (about a 15 min drive, or a $10 Uber ride). The house was also walking distance from a park/golf course and coffee shops. You can't beat the price for the location and amount of space this place has. I only wish we could've stayed longer!",
