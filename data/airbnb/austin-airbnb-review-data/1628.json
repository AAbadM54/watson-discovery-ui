  "text": "Dallas was a great host and we very much enjoyed our long-weekend stay and first visit to Austin. Seven of our college friends reunited in Austin and the house was comfortable, with plenty of room to sleep, a decent dining room/living room to hand out and a very workable kitchen. \r\n\r\nThe location was convenient and Dallas' instructions for getting into the house were perfectly clear. It was easy to Uber everywhere (surprisingly close to the airport and downtown - less than a 10 minute ride!) and there was also easy parking in the attached garage. He was flexible and communicative about checkin/checkout times and even made some great suggestion about what we shouldn't miss on our first trip to Austin. \r\n\r\n The only slightly misleading aspect of the listing is that it's a 2.5 bath (2 showers) which was not what we'd anticipated, but worked perfectly fine.",
