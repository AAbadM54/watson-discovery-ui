  "text": "Loved it! Great location--super close to 6th (short cab ride). Definitely would stay there again. I live in the area, but not close to downtown. Frequently go dowtown for girls' nights and like to stay down there. Love how we had our own space. Neighbors aren't right on top of you, so you can have privacy sitting out in the yard. Host is very friendly and responsive. Definitely keeping this one as an option for next time!",
