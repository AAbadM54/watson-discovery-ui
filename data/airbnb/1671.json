  "text": "This was hands-down the nicest AirBnB I have ever stayed in. The house is absolutely beautiful, and very tastefully decorated.\r\n\r\nThe backyard deck is great for relaxing outside in the evenings. The AC in the house works very well and was great for combatting the summer heat. The location of the house was great, in a calm and green neighborhood but a short drive to many attractions. There is also a great brewery/pizzeria walking distance from the house.\r\n\r\nCommunication with Ayn was very smooth, and it was easy to coordinate checkin of the house. I would recommend this rental to anybody traveling to Austin.",
