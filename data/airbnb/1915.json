  "text": "Awesome Apartment!  Highly recommend staying here!  You can't go wrong with two balconies, nice living room with netflix and a full kitchen.  Brett was very accommodating and prompt with any questions or concerns we would have.   This was our first AirBnB experience and it makes us wonder why we wasted all our travels booking rooms in hotels when you get something as great as this!",
