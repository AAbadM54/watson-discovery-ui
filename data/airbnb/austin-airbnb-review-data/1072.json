  "text": "I had a great experience for my first stay at an AirB&B! For the past 20 plus years I've been traveling for business, staying in the typical Holiday Inn's and other mid level to upper level hotels. Being tired of the points game that's becoming a watered down racket I decided to try something new. Courtney's treehouse apartment was a nice change form my normal chain hotel routine.  My stay lasted 29 days and I felt right at home every minuet. Coming from a small country village, I was surprised at how quite the apartment was for being in the city. The birds were a bit loud in the trees that heavily shade the west side of the apartment but I looked at this as a good problem. \"Lol\"  It was an easy downhill 2 mile walk to the city center but not so easy going up the hill. Take the bus back unless you want or need a workout. During my 29 days I was able to meet many of the neighbors and they all seamed nice and welcoming. Courtney treehouse apartment had everything I needed and so much more than a hotel. Thanks Courtney !",
