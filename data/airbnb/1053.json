  "text": "There aren't enough positive words for me to describe our experience at Julie's East Austin Bungalow.  \r\n\r\nAs we recently re-located to Austin from LA, we rented Julie's house for an entire month while we looked for permanent digs.  Not only is the house cozy, convenient, and ridiculously affordable, but Julie and her husband David couldn't have been more accommodating.\r\n\r\nWe couldn't have asked for a nice welcoming committee to our new city.  They were full of great tips, checked in on us (even dropped off flannel sheets when the temps dipped into the low 30s!), and made us feel we instantly had friends in town.  Their bungalow will always be our first \"home\" in Austin.\r\n\r\nWe will certainly recommend Julie's house to friends visiting in the future.  For the space (including a large deck and yard), quick drive to  Austin's main attractions, and gracious hosts, you can't ask for better for the price.",
