  "text": "Lotus House was the perfect place for my stay in Austin. Allyson is relaxed, very nice and is also helpful in terms of places to eat nearby. There are plenty! I liked the location- quiet in a nice neighborhood but very near Lamar avenue and the rest of town. Lotus House itself is very attractive. I would definitely come back here.",
