  "text": "My friends and I loved Angela ' s place! The first thing we noticed was how clean and bright it was which made us feel very comfortable. Pictures are accurate. Great location, close to Penn Station. Great for a group of 4 to 6. Enough street noise one night to warrant bringing ear plugs. Angela was welcoming and made our stay easy.",
