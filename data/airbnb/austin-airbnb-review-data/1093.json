  "text": "Robin and Mike were so gracious in their hospitality in so many ways! From helping me out with my reservation problems, to offering my dog Sophie a comfy bed and, even letting me bake my favorite cookies in their kitchen! Their home is a great respite for those needing to relax, especially with the lovely bed and the claw footed bath tub. (Note: the bed is every bit as comfortable as promised!)\r\n\r\nThe Bouldin Creek neighborhood is charming, wacky and full of great restaurants and coffee shops. I live in Austin and I can't think of a better place to stay if you are visiting for the first time, or, if you live in the area and want to do a great \"staycation\" and soak in one of Austin's most creative neighborhoods.\r\n\r\nMy dog, Sophie, would like to report to other furry friends that she was lavished with affection and slept on one of the biggest dog beds ever, thanks to our hosts! She gives it a five \"paws\" rating.",
