  "text": "The apartment is located right south of Downtown Austin. Great location with plenty of nearby options for food and drinks as well as public transportation. We chose this apartment due to its proximity to Zilker Park, since we were in town for ACL Festival. It worked quite well since we pretty much walked everywhere. Patrick was a great host and provided all the necessary information and amenities in the apartment. He also gave us some local tips on what to do in the area.",
