  "text": "The listing met and exceeded expectations. The mattresses were so comfortable that my friend made a point of finding out what kind they were so that she could get one for herself. We highly appreciated that there was coffee, and popsicles. All of the closets and dressers were empty, and ready for our things. The interior and property were clean. Dallas was in contact prior to the stay, making sure that everything was set and in place.\r\nThe location is very convenient for getting to a bunch of the food trucks, shopping, and natural areas that we wanted to visit, and felt very safe.\r\nThe only thing that I would say to be mindful of is that the garage was a bit of a squeeze for the van that we rented, but there was plenty of street parking.",
