  "text": "i was happy with this introductory to airbnb, in fact to any bnb....much more pleasant than motels.  linda was enthusiastically welcoming and accommodating and informative about the area and airbnb itself.  she's had a varied and interesting life and is an accomplished woman overall.  she is open-hearted and warm, and makes the guest feel at home quite easily.\r\n\r\nthe area is quiet, well-groomed, and easy to navigate.  there are shopping and eateries nearby with easy access to freeways for farther destinations.\r\n\r\ni'll look forward to staying with her again in the future....as linda herself said \"i feel like i've made a new friend.\"",
