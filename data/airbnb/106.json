  "text": "Neighborhood was fine. this is like a couch in the living room. However, I think the place could have been much more cleaner. The kitchen, and hall were not clean ( I had to change the sheets too,as I found some cat like hair), lot of residue in the kitchen too & bathroom sink. I don't expect luxuries for such a low price, but at least a clean place. Cleanliness was my only and major issue, rest was ok.",
