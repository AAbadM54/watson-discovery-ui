  "text": "I stayed at Yolanda's place because I took a test at ACC Highland, which is near by.  The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable.  I got a chance to meet Yolanda just before I checked out and she was friendly.  The location is convenient to many Austin hot spots. I would recommend this place.",
