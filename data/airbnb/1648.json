  "text": "This was our first time staying at an AirBnB and it was a great experience.  Dallas was friendly and was always available to answer questions.  He gave clear and easy to follow instructions on how to locate his condo, how to get in and what expectations he had when we left.  He also checked in time to time to make sure we were comfortable and didn't have any issues with our stay.  The condo was beautiful and in a great location.  We were in austin for a wedding and had a car but used an uber occasionally to get to downtown and explore austin which was pretty cheap.   Overall it was an amazing experience and I would highly recommend working with Dallas and using any of his properties listed on airbnb.  The only negative thing I would have to say is that the room downstairs which is located right below the master bedroom can get loud and you can hear everything (Steps/talking) that goes on upstairs which makes it hard to sleep through.",
