  "text": "The apartment was just as pictured. It was lovely and very roomy for a NY one bedroom apt. Very convenient to public transportation. Renovated and very clean. Bed was nice and comfortable. I think it was a Memory foam mattress. Radiators make a bit of noise at night but that is just the nature of an old NY building. They all do it. If you are a light sleeper pack some ear plugs. It was a small thing. The apartment is great!",
