  "text": "Sue was the best. This was my first experience with Airbnb and we were happily surprised by how excellent and easy the service and apartment was. She offered to pick us up at the airport, had snacks and beer in the fridge. The apartment was comfortable and very centrally located. Gates parking spot and gated pedestrian access made for a sense of security. Can't recommend her any higher!",
