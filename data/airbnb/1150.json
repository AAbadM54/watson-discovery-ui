  "text": "Sue was a great host who had everything taken care of. It was a busy weekend with ACL and loads of conferences, but she made sure that we made it to the condo safely and even had an assistant who gave us great recommendations for restaurants and the night life that Austin has to offer. There are so many positive things I can say about the condo. Along with it being clean, stylish and safe, it's a perfect location that's walking distance to so many great restaurants, food trucks and sights. After a couple days, I really felt at home there. Definitely a stellar first visit to Austin!",
