  "text": "I've visited SXSW this year and had the pleasure to stay at Annas Bungalow. Everything was setup and worked perfectly and I felt at home the moment I've turned the keys. There was even some beer in the fridge, the right way to treat a guest :-)\r\nThe Bungalow itself and the attached garden is wonderful, so I can highly recommend this place if you're looking for a quite place to stay.",
