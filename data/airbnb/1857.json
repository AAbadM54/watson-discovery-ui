  "text": "Blaine is very kind and his place was both very inviting and provided a delightful experience. The room I stayed in was comfortable, clean, and the house was in a safe area. I didn't get a chance to enjoy the vinyl collection since it was such a short visit, but what an awesome place and vibe.  The home itself is charming and I felt very welcome! Blaine even gave me a ride to dinner as he was on his way out. Such a great stay. Thanks, Blaine!",
