  "text": "Trey was very welcoming, and always ensured he tried to resolve any issues we had quickly. The accommodation was as described and as shown in the pictures. The Garden was very wild when we arrived but was sorted during our stay. The neighbourhood was excellent and was only 5 mins away from South Congress. One issue with the accommodation was when calling ubers they always seemed to get confused so it's best to put your location as academy Drive when calling one",
