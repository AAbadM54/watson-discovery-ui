  "text": "The place was great! Exactly as Dallas described and as the pictures show. He was very communicative and left a very welcoming 12 pack of Lone Star for  our arrival toasts! Austin is a very large city and we did lots of driving from our son's house to the wedding venue and back again, but the location was perfect! We would definitely recommend Dallas' place! We had 3 couples and and one extra adult who slept on the twin mattress in the loft. We were quite comfortable.",
