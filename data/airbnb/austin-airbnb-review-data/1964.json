  "text": "Emily's house was exactly as advertised! It was perfect for our group of four for a weekend in Austin: convenient location to DKR stadium (we could have walked!), a nice and safe neighborhood without a ton of traffic and just a short drive to most Austin spots!\r\n\r\nShe was very prompt in responding to all of our messages prior to our stay and left a very helpful guidebook with info on the house and suggestions for places to eat nearby. She even left us a few goodies on the counter for when we arrived. Great stay, would definitely go back if we are down in Austin!",
