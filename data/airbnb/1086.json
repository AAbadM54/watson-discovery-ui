  "text": "We had a great time with our hosts in Austin. It was such a great location near several popular restaurants and coffee shops, the house was gorgeous, and our room was excellent. We had a great time meeting our hosts, as I think they were the most friendly we've met on AirBNB to date. I highly recommend this listing for future guests.",
