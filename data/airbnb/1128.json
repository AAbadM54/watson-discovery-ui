  "text": "I can't say enough nice things about Sue and her condo.  Sue is such a warm and kind person and was always willing to help me out in any way possible, if needed.  The condo is a beautiful, open, sunny space and I immediately felt comfortable there the minute I walked in.  The place could not have been cleaner, which I truly appreciate.  Sue had every accomodation needed - she even had snacks and beer waiting for me on my arrival!  The bedroom is very cozy - I love the darkening drapes and I slept better in that bed than I do in my own!  Also love the nice big bathroom.  All in all I couldn't have asked for a  better place to stay in Austin.  I work from home and this was a longer term stay for me - I was there for 3 weeks.  Very quiet building - the walls are soundproof, which made it very easy to work during the day.  The location is awesome - I could walk east to the cool bars/restaurants on east 6th, or head west to downtown.  I appreciated the private parking spot - parking was very easy and safe.  5 stars - I highly recommend Sue and her condo!!",
