  "text": "My wife and I came down to ATX for the Cap Tex (website hidden) was our first time use Airbnb. I didn't get to meet Linda but her instructions were very clear. Her house was very nice, comfortable, and clean. It was at a good location with healthy food options nearby. We ate at Kerbey's for breakfast, the rest of the time we were closer to downtown. It only a 10-15 min drive to downtown.  I plan to check airbnb first when I travel now.",
