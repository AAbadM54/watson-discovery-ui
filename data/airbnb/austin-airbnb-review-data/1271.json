Jon, Tri's roommate at the time of my visit, was a gracious and welcoming host in Tri's stead (Tri was out of town for the most part of my stay, but when he returned, near the tail end of my trip, he was just as welcoming). \n\nTheir home is walking distance to the UT campus, Lyft distance to anything else that matters and is clean and secure. Enjoy!",
