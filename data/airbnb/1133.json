  "text": "LOVE this condo! The style, location, and feel was like a modern hotel suite, but with personalized service you can't find at any hotel.  Best out of town stay Ive had! Sue is AWESOME, she has such a bright and caring personality.  She made sure we we're taken care of from the start to checking out.  Next visit to Austin, I'll book with her again!",
