  "text": "Chad is a great guy and very responsive to everything. The apartment was great and exactly what was promised (although I wish it was clearer that the second bedroom was a loft). Chad went above and beyond expectations on making our stay wonderful. He was an excellent communicator and even checked-in throughout the weekend to make sure we were doing. The neighborhood is a close drive to everywhere in Austin but there is not much walking distance from the apartment, which is fine, considering its really easy to find parking anywhere in Austin. We loved our visit and our stay in this apartment.",
