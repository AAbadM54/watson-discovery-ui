  "text": "Great place to stay near South Congress. The house was clean and very nicely decorated, with a social and functional layout. It easily fitted out eight person party. The hostess was very considerate, and offered us lots of help in finding things to do and places to eat. Not only are there plenty of shops, bars and restaurants nearby, but also lots of green areas and running trails. We were there for only two nights, but would have loved to stay for longer.",
