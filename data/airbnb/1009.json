  "text": "We had a wonderful time during our stay here. The house was even prettier than the pictures and our hosts were VERY accommodating (when I asked if there was an iron in the rental they brought over a brand new iron and ironing board). They also have very cute, friendly dogs in the gated-in area behind the house, which was a big plus. There were good coffee shops/restaurants in walking distance from the house, and Uber/Lyft rides to Downtown Austin were very affordable. Would definitely recommend.",
