  "text": "I rented Alyson's Lotus House Library bedroom for my intern who is town from Europe. The house is great and in a very convenient location. Everything was tidy and clean and Alyson was a great host. My intern was very pleased throughout his 2 week stay.\r\n\r\nI will definitely be renting from Alyson again.\r\n\r\nMatt S.",
