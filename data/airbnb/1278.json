  "text": "Tri is an absolute legend! Could not have been happier with my stay. Tri and Ronin made me feel very welcome and the place was exactly as advertised. Tri is the type of host that's happy to hang out and give you advice on things to do around town; or simply leave you to do you're own thing if that's more your twist.Really enjoyed my 4 nights with Tri. I'll be back ASAP. Thanks again mate, 'Yall' welcome in Aus anytime you want!\r\nTom",
