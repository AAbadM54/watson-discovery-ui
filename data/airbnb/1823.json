  "text": "Jonathan & Carley provided clear and easy instructions for checking into the apartment and checking out. The cottage was just as it looked in the pictures, apart from some small furniture differences in the main bedroom.  They provided all the essentials and were also kind enough to let my pet dog stay with us as well! \r\n\r\nThe highlight of the stay ended up being the location--very close to Mopac and walking distance to Lady Bird Lake, where I could go for a run with the dog!",
