  "text": "Kyle and his family have an amazing home! The interior is very relaxing, and supremely clean. We arrived to find the house in immaculate shape, towels laid out on the bed, and the lights on so we wouldn't be left in the dark. He checked in on us during our stay to make sure we were comfortable. The location of the house is great, and the proximity to restaurants, downtown Austin, and a major freeway is a major plus. I would definitely go back for a visit!",
