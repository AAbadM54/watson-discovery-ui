  "text": "I had a wonderful time! It was a little chilly even with the space heater, and the water took a little longer to heat up, but that was the weather this past weekend - nothing to be done about that. The place was honestly the best, most fun little place I have ever stayed at. The sheets are gorgeous as was the airstream. Because it was so chilly this weekend, they had the heater turned on before I even arrived which was thoughtful. I only saw my host briefly in the beginning, but since everything was cut and dry, it was fine by me. I was out in downtown Austin most of the day anyway. Also the neighbors dog is probably the most annoying dog I've ever met. But again that is out of any ones control. \n\nSome notes for future travelers - the bus stop to go to downtown Austin really is just across the street but because it is a busier intersection you do have to go all the way to the stop light to cross. Also, be sure to take some time to just sit outside - it is quiet and in a quiet neighborhood. I loved it and will book them again if I ever am back in Texas.",
