  "text": "Melissa was excellent!  She was available to answer questions and very cordial.  The home was fantastic.  Would definitely stay there again, very spacious, cozy and well cared for.  The privacy is nice, it was pouring rain (first time in a long time), so we didn't get to utilize the great backyard, but did use the covered porch a lot.  The home would be great for wedding parties, reunions, etc.",
