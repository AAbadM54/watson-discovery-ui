  "text": "Sue...and her place...was amazing!  First off, it's so centrally located to everything central Austin has to offer.  Quick drive to UT.  Walk to great coffee shops/restaurants/bars in East Austin...or Sixth St...or Rainey St.  I'd warm-up during the .5 mile to Town Lake to run along the best running path in the country.\r\n\r\nHer place is very comfortable.  The perfect size for one person or a small family.  It was a working trip for me, so found the place very conducive for this.  Really fast internet was a plus.\r\n\r\nSue welcomes you with a tour, a bowl of apples, and bowl of various bags of snacks...she's the epitome of that Austin warmth.  I'd rent from her again in a second!",
