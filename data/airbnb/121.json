  "text": "Cathy was very welcoming! The house is in a perfect location in reference to location from the city, as well as the distance from the local train station. If flying in I advise flying into JFK because the A-train is a straight shot. The home is exactly as pictured and sometimes you forget that you are staying in an air bnb. I would absolutely stay again, and I can honestly say that I can't complain about anything.",
