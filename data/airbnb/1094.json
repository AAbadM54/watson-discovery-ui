  "text": "This was our second stay with Robin & Mike and they made Sophie, my German Shorthaired Pointer, and I feel right at home! She got to enjoy their great dog bed and lots of scratches behind the ears. I got to hang out with two friendly folks and walk in a charming neighborhood. Pro Tip: try the Mulligatawny at The Soup Peddler (cross streets: S. First & Mary)",
