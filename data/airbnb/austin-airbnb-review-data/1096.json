  "text": "My father was visiting Austin for a few days to check out a music festival I host in Austin. It's a crazy busy time for me so I decided to put him up in a house in my neighborhood. Robin and Mike were extremely accommodating and met me in person so I could take a look at the house and discuss specifics. My father enjoyed his stay and commented (frequently) about how comfortable the bed was... The downstairs living space is super spacious with all the amenities one would need. My father was super comfortable and his staying here allowed him the space he wanted, while still remaining just a couple blocks from my house (and the festival).. Robin and Mike are great folks and their place is very nice.",
