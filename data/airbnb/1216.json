  "text": "I had a good time staying in the airstream.  Renee and Thomas were quick and responsive to my questions.\n\nNot having a bathroom was a bit of an adventure at night, since you need to go to the main house for that.\n\nOverall I had a great time and would recommend this place.  Next time I would stay in the house, because that seemed like a better value and it has a nice aesthetic too.",
