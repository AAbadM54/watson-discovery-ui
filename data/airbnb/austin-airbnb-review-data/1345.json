  "text": "Everything at Jinny & Daisy's place was fantastic; they're both very sweet and accommodating. The house is very hip with a great colorful vibe decorated with Jinny's art. The bed was very comfortable and the stay was even better than I had expected. I'd definitely recommend the stay for anyone interested in a quiet comfortable stay in Austin.",
