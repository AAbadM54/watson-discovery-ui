  "text": "Anna is wonderful! She helped me adjust a reservation without any problem and came to the rescue with a last minute recommendation to solve a wedding emergency. This small home feels spacious â€” and the back yard with multiple decks, chiminea, grill, and landscaping is wonderful. The kitchen is well-equipped, including a delightful assortment of spices. All cleaners, detergents, towels, TP, etc... very well stocked. Great recycling! Very comfortable beds. I could continue to go on and on -- we were very happy. As for the neighborhood, we accidentally left the front door wide open for 12+ hours with three computers lying around the house. We had no problems at all.",
