  "text": "John was very welcoming and easy to communicate with. He was also very responsive when I had any questions. His apartment was very clean and comfy and the neighborhood felt very safe. There were many bars, restaurants, and subway in the area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe provided shampoo/conditioner, towels, toilet paper, dishes, wine glasses/bottle opener, body soap, pretty much everything I needed to enjoy the apartment as if I lived there. He had netflix too!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only negative was that the heat was centrally controlled making the apartment quite warm at times; however, an open window easily solved that issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll in all, everything was great and I would highly recommend staying at this location.",
