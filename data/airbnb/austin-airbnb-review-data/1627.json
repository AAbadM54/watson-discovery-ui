  "text": "Dallas was great.  He was very responsive via text and quickly answered any questions we might have.  House was clean and spacious.  It worked great for 4 adults and Neighborhood felt safe and was a short drive to South Congress and downtown Austin.  Garage parking was nice and we took advantage of the pool on the grounds of the townhouse community.",
