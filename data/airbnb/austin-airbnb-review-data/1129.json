  "text": "We stayed at Sue's condo over Memorial Day weekend and couldn't have had a better time. She was very accommodating to all our needs and did everything she could to make us feel welcome, and I couldn't have been happier with the arrangements. The location is ideal, as it's an easy walk to East Sixth, Downtown, as well as several other bar and restaurant districts in Austin.",
