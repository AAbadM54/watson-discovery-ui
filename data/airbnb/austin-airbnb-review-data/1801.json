  "text": "AMAZING!! The host was very accessible and everything went exactly according to plan. The house is ADORABLE and the pool is fantastic. The host did a great job at labeling everything so it was very easy to get comfortable quickly. We had children ages 9 to 17 stay at the house and we all loved it. The house is also great for common gathering areas and found it great to play cards/spoons at the breakfast bar yet private enough where if someone wanted to relax they could also do that in another area. The outside areas are very fun with something for everyone. If someone isn't into the pool, there are several other areas that they can relax in like outdoor living rooms. Thanks for making the visit such a special one that it will not be forgotten!! We HIGHLY recommend visiting this property if you're in Austin - the location is great (6 miles from downtown) with quick access to bike routes, new hip restaurants, a grocery store and Walgreens.",
