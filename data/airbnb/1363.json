  "text": "First time using Airbnb for me, but with such a positive experience we'll definitely use it again. Ben was a great host from the second we walked and gave us some great advice on Austin's bars and eats. The ramen place down the street form his place is on point. \r\n\r\nWe stayed over ACL weekend and the house is in a great location for public transportation. Ben even gave us a couple free bus passes. No complaints about the house either, just great all around stay. Highly recommend to anybody.",
