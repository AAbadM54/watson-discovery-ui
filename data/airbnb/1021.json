  "text": "The bungalow was the perfect place to stay during Parent's Weekend at UT. Just north of campus in a lovely and peaceful neighborhood with lots of green space nearby and my favorite vegetarian cafe down the road on Duval. The house was pretty, clean, light-filled and quiet. Everything we needed was there (great towels and linens!) and the porch was the perfect place to drink the very good coffee that Ananda and Dunstan provided. Thanks so much! We will be back!",
