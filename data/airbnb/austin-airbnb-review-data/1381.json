  "text": "Sydney was a great host. This was my first airbnb experience, and it couldn't have been made easier. Everything was clean and comfortable, and looks as exactly as advertised. The apartment is close enough to the action that you can still walk, but still far enough that you're not bothered by any noise. It's also a great location for runners, as it's close to the Ladybird Hike and Bike Trail.",
