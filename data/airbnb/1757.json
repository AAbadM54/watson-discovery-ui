  "text": "We couldn't have asked for a better host--Ash was extremely accomodating and responsive. Her husband Frank came by to bring us fire wood and install a grill and even took one person from our group to the doctor after sustaining a minor leg injury the day before. Casa SoCo was great and even better than in the pictures. Good location and walking distance from all the shops and restaurants on Congress and 1st. Would highly recommend staying here.",
