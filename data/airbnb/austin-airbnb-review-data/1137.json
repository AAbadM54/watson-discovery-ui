  "text": "Checkin: The experience was perfect. Her daughter Carson checked me in and was very cheerful, even though I was 2+ hours late due to my train into Austin running behind.\r\n\r\nHome: It was wonderful. Very clean and modern, everything worked nicely. The A/C worked so well, I forgot it was summer in Texas. And the Internet/wifi is very fast. Great light in the living room with the big windows too.\r\n\r\nProximity: So close to all the great East Side bar and food truck spots. 15-20 minute walk to Rainey and downtown means you can have fun over there and then come back to peace.\r\n\r\nI would definitely stay at Sue's place again.",
