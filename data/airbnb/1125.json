  "text": "From the moment a coworker and I booked the condo, Sue kept in touch with us and made us feel completely welcome! The condo itself was immaculate, so cute, and only an 8 minute walk to downtown Austin - close to all of the hustle and bustle, while being situated in a quiet neighborhood. Sue went above and beyond - giving us a tour of the condo when we arrived, leaving snacks for us in advance, and even buying us local Austin beer to try out. The accommodation itself was lovely and very comfortable - we felt right at home! Additionally, Sue created her own board on Air B&B of her top Austin recommendations, and should we have needed anything, provided her cell number to us. Neither of us had been to Austin before but this amazing condo really allowed us to enjoy our stay and feel comfortable in a new city. Highly recommend this rental, especially because Sue is the sweetest!",
