  "text": "Dallas' 3bd/3ba was perfect form my extended family and our weeklong stay. Two master suites with King beds, a 3rd bedroom with a queen bed and a twin mattress fit our needs exactly. Quick access to   I-35, Travis Heights, SoCo & E. Austin make it ideal for soaking up Austin's Weird. Travis was always in contact, and made sure we had access to everything in the Condo complex.",
