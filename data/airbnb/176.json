  "text": "My stay and Jeff's apartment was perfect. Everything lived up to the description and you cannot beat the location. Jeff was super accommodating and helpful. I was headed to New York in the middle of the blizzard and it caused my flight to get delayed. Jeff was great in making sure the keys were in a safe place waiting for me when I finally was able to get into the city.   I will definitely want to stay here again in the future. Very comfortable and super convenient.",
