  "text": "My son and I loved staying here for part of our vacation to Austin!\r\n\r\nThe location is wonderful, very close to South Congress & First Street. I used Car2Go and it was easy to get around. The trailer is absolutely fantastic, and such a treat at night with the amazing lighting!\r\n\r\nRene is always available and very fast to respond to your needs! She was very helpful when I asked her for some items for our trip to Barton Springs t, which included a really amazing vintage Pac-Man blanket and a little something for my son! This was a very nice touch that I personally really enjoyed :) \r\n\r\nGreat hosts- really unique experience!!!",
