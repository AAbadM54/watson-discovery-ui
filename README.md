Cognitive Discovery UI

Code pattern to provide working example of:
- Utilizing Watson Discovery service built with external data
- Node.js API server using the Express web framework
- HTML frontend written in React with React and semantic-ui-react components

# Steps
## 1. Clone the repo
```
$ git clone https://github.com/rhagarty/disco-ui
```
## 2. Create Watson Discovery collection
## 3. Load collection with data files

IMPORTANT! Before loading data, define a new "Configuration" and add 'Keyword" extraction to enrichments.

Data represents reviews from AirBnB for rentals in New York City.

Files can be found in [data/airbnb](data/airbnb)

## 4. Configure credentials
```
cp env.sample .env
```
Edit the `.env` file with the necessary settings

## 5. Run the application
```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
Run the UI, by entering the following URL in your browser:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

# Sample UI layout

## UI controls and associated actions

1. Search field and search parameters - return results based on search criteria. Search parameters will effect how the user will enter values, how they will be displayed, and limit the number of matches.
2. Filter fields - Drop down lists of filters that can be applied to search resullts. Each drop down list contains entities/categories/concepts/keywords associated with results. For each drop down filter item, the number of matches will also be displayed. If a user selects a filter item, a new search will be conducted and will update the results panel (#3). Filter items selected will also effect what is shown in the tag cloud (#4).
3. Search results and pagination menu - shows result items (e.g. 5 per page) and a pagination menu that allows user to scroll through pages of result items.
4. Tag cloud - similar to the filter fields (#2) but in a different form. Associated drop down list will determine which filter items to display (default is 'entity'). User can select/deselect items in the cloud to turn on/off filters. Applied filters in both #2 and here should always be in sync.
5. Trend chart - 
6. Sentiment chart - donut chart that shows the total sentiment for search results. Associated drop down lists allow the user to show only those sentiment values for a filter type (default is 'entity'), or a specific filter value of a filter type.

# TODO List:
- ~~Add 'keyword' extraction to discovery collection and represent the data as a filter (i.e. same UI components found for entities, categories, and concepts).~~
- ~~Add UI component to allow user to enter either strict `discovery langauge query` syntax (e.g. 'text:"new york"') or simple `natural langauge query' (default and already done).~~
- ~~Add UI component to allow user to limit the number of matches to 100.~~
- Add UI component to allow user to specify they would like matches displayed with `passages` for result descriptions (instead of just dump of text field).
- Add 'trending' graph to bottom left of web page. Graph will be independent of other UI components, and show sentiment trending of each of the filter options (entities, categories, concepts, and keywords).
- Add 'Deploy to IBM Cloud' option. This includes the automation of loading discovery data.
- Display sentiment value with each result.
- Use arrow functions for callbacks to avoid having to 'bind(this)'.
- Add unit tests.
- Improve look and feel with CSS. This includes:
  - Make column depth fixed size so data doesn't jump around on page. 
  - Center pagination menu in 'matches' window.
  - Eliminate space when pagination menu is not shown.
  - Sentiment chart needs to default to "Term" when initally shown.
  - ~~Change 'loading...' panel to white background to avoid flash when new search is conducted.~~

# Privacy Notice

If using the `Deploy to IBM Cloud` button some metrics are tracked, the following information is sent to a [Deployment Tracker](https://github.com/IBM/metrics-tracker-service) service on each deployment:

* Node.js package version
* Node.js repository URL
* Application Name (`application_name`)
* Application GUID (`application_id`)
* Application instance index number (`instance_index`)
* Space ID (`space_id`)
* Application Version (`application_version`)
* Application URIs (`application_uris`)
* Labels of bound services
* Number of instances for each bound service and associated plan information

This data is collected from the `package.json` file in the sample application and the ``VCAP_APPLICATION`` and ``VCAP_SERVICES`` environment variables in IBM Cloud and other Cloud Foundry platforms. This data is used by IBM to track metrics around deployments of sample applications to IBM Cloud to measure the usefulness of our examples, so that we can continuously improve the content we offer to you. Only deployments of sample applications that include code to ping the Deployment Tracker service will be tracked.

## Disabling Deployment Tracking

To disable tracking, simply remove `require("metrics-tracker-client").track();` from the ``app.js`` file in the top level directory.
