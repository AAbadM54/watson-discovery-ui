  "text": "Joe's place is amazing. The interior decorating is beautiful as well as the layout of the houseâ€”you feel right at home. Rooftop was a lovely bonus. Great proximity to downtown and cute little restaurants close by the house (we used the bikes!). Booking went really smoothly. Comfortably slept our large party of 8 during SXSW. We hope to come back again!",
