  "text": "My boyfriend and I just finished a weeks stay at the Quaint Cottage. It was perfect for our needs. Jonathan and Carley were super responsive to any questions I had prior to my stay. (This was our first Airbnb experience). The cottage itself has tons of character. It's set back in a wooded area which is very nice. I told my boyfriend I felt like we were in a log cabin in the mountains of Tennessee, not a mile from the Capital! So, if privacy is what you're after, this is your place. Also, the bed is very comfortable and the A/C ROCKS. The thermostat was set to the perfect temp when we checked in and we didn't have to mess with it at all. Which is amazing considering what the temps were outside. We weren't actually in the cottage much other than to sleep and shower, but it had everything we needed for our stay. I will say this, if you need brand new accommodations, you should keep looking but if you like quirky and antique, this fits the bill. One little note... there is some major construction on Mopac (the highway) that was happening at night, so if you're a light sleeper, might want to bring earplugs. But that should be temporary. Overall we were satisfied. Thank you!",
