  "text": "Julie's apartment was just as described and the perfect launching pad for us while visiting friends. It was clean and comfortable and Julie was very responsive to any questions before and during our stay. She went out of her way to make us feel comfortable, even stocking the kitchen with some breakfast items for when we arrived. We were traveling with young children and the upstairs loft area was great for them to have their own space. Quiet neighborhood but very close to everything. Would highly recommend!",
