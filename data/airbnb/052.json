  "text": "This place is absolutely amazing. Eric is a very cool dude. The bed is incredibly comfortable. I had my own desk and nice office chair to work from. Location is also a huge plus, just 2 blocks away from the G line. The bedroom was really clean and I had all I could need from clean sheets to towels. This is by far the best place I've found in Greenpoint/Williamsburg so far and plan to stay here again if possible.",
