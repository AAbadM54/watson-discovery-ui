  "text": "I wasn't sure what to expect on our first AirBnb stay but I was pleasantly surprised with Marc's hospitality! The condo is very nice and comfortable. You could tell Marc took the time to prepare for our visit by providing clean towels, sheets, bottled water and some OJ + bagels for breakfast. We were in town for SXSW and Marc offered to pick us up/drop us off at the airport. He also showed us around Austin and gave us rides to and from downtown if he was available. Best of all Marc is a great guy to hang out with. I enjoyed his company and am looking forward to our next trip to Austin.",
