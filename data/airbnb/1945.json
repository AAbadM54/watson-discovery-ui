  "text": "Great place to stay! Good location (within 2-3 miles of campus and downtown) in a peaceful, safe neighborhood and good restaurants just a couple of blocks away. No problems with parking. The house was very clean and comfortable and a perfect place to relax. The host was easy to contact by phone and email and very friendly and helpful. He even left some great pesto for us to eat! I would recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in the Austin area.",
