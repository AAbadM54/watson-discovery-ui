  "text": "We had a wonderful experience with Ananda and Dunstan.  The bungalow was perfect and immaculately kept. Arrangements and entry were seamless.    The little bungalow was well equipped with everything you could need. Nice restaurants and shops for food etc were just steps away.  It's a  wonderful little neighborhood  close to everything Ananda and Dunstan were available and attentive but also laid back.  We plan on returning there whenever we come to Austin.  And we love the dogs who were fun but didn't disturb us a bit.",
