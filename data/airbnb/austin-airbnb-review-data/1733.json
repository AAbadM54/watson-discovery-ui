  "text": "The house was just like it looked in all the pictures. Anna the hostess, was very helpful and the communications were excellent. The house was very clean and comfortable. Both beds were nice, with good mattresses. The neighborhood was convenient for where we wanted to be in Austin, though it is a bit transitional. overall we were very happy with our stay and would stay there again on our next visit.",
