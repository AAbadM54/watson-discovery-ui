  "text": "Casa Soco was amazing! We stayed here for a bachelorette party and couldn't have wished for a more beautiful house to stay in! Ashley was such a wonderful host and gave so many recommendations for places to check out and things to do in Austin. Can't thank her enough for helping to make our stay so memorable. It was perfect!",
