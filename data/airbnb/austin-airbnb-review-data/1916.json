  "text": "Great little flat well located, and we loved the decor, especially in the bedroom! Sofa bed was plenty comfy for a one night stay. For those sleeping on the sofa bed, bring an eye mask for the Austin morning light, and maybe a pair of earplugs if you're not used to air con noise. Fantastic to have car parking space also.",
