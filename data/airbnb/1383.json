  "text": "My husband, sister and I stayed at Linda's house this past weekend for a really quick trip for a family wedding in Austin. Linda was so kind and hospitable and made us feel right at home from the moment we stepped in the door. Her house is absolutely spotless, the rooms are comfortable, and Linda is fun to talk to! The location of Linda's house is very close to major highways and a quick drive to downtown. Having lived in Austin, I am very partial to the area of Linda's house and love staying in the southwest area of the city when I visit. I highly recommend Linda's house for your next trip down to Austin, you will not be disappointed!",
