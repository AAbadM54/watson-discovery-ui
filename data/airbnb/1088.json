  "text": "Mike and Robin were so super cool and welcoming. We got a quick tour and such a great welcome. Mike and Robin asked us which beer we liked, and picked up a few for us too!\r\n\r\nThe room is gorgeous, quiet and comfortable. We slept very well and even though we only stayed the one night, we will probably stay here again the next time we visit Austin. Their house is close to so many cool places to be.\r\n\r\nThere was a great binder in the room with all of the info you could need about the area, the room, amenities, etc.",
