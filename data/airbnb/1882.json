  "text": "My girlfriend and I visited Austin for the first time and had the pleasure of staying at the condo for the extent of our trip. Not only was the condo tastefully decorated and immaculately clean, it was also situated perfectly- close enough to walk downtown and the Capitol building and just far enough away from the craziness of Sixth St.\n\nBrett as a host was attentive to our needs and incredibly accommodating. He even went out of his way to pick up our luggage the first morning before we checked in to allow us to roam around without the hassle of carrying our things. When we arrived at the condo, he had a six pack of local beer already cold and waiting for us- a simple but thoughtful way of welcoming us to a new city. Between the excellent recommendations and the occasional \"y'all need anything?\" check in texts, Brett was nothing short of great host.\n\nOur overwhelmingly positive experience with Brett and the condo was key to the success of our trip. Whether you've been to Austin once or one hundred times, you'll be hard pressed to find better accommodations!",
