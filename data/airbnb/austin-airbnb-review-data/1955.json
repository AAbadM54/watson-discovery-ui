  "text": "Perfect place to stay for ACL weekend. Brought our bikes and rode down to Zilker park.. Wasn't a bad ride at all! House was clean and Kyle was an awesome host. Found out beforehand that he actually grew up with my family which made it that much more interesting. Kyle made us feel at home and welcomed us like family. He communicated very easily and explained the ins and outs of his house well. He even let us come up early to park our cars before the festival. I would recommend staying here any time!",
