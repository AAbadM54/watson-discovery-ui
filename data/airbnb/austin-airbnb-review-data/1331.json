  "text": "Patrick’s place was perfect for the brief visit to Austin my fiancée and I made for a friend’s wedding at nearby Zilker Gardens. Not only was the apartment very conveniently located, it was neat, clean, comfortable, and Patrick was a great host: welcoming, friendly, and respectful. Upon arrival we walked over to the ABGB (Austin Beer Garden and Brewery) for lunch on his recommendation and really enjoyed the music, beer, and food. Added perks: Patrick gave us access to his Roku, the apartment is only about a 10-15 minute drive from the airport, and we were able to get Uber rides within 5 minutes of ordering. Highly recommended.",
