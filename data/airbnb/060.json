  "text": "This was a really wonderful apartment.  Myself and two friends stayed here for a couple of days - it was ideal for our stay and was only a short trip into the city. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApartment was really clean, warm and well taken care of - Lasata was really pleasant, and although we were a little late coming into the city there was no problem getting keys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould definitely recommend staying here for anyone looking to visit NYC.",
