  "text": "This was by far the best Airbnb experience I've ever had. Sue is the most friendly, accommodating, and thoughtful host and everything about the unit reflects this. First of all, she picked me up from the airport -- seriously! After arriving at the condo, I was amazing to discover that there was a basket of snacks, beers and water in the fridge, amazingly well-stocked bathroom, and a folder with so many great nearby recommendations. She spent a lot of time with me making sure I had everything I needed for an amazing stay. I really could go on and on about my experience, but I think you get the idea. Thanks again for everything Sue.",
