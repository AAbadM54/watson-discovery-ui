Great location not far from my favorite places when I went to college in Austin, only a few miles from South Congress, downtown and Barton Springs.\r\n\r\nStayed very cool inside too!\r\n\r\nThank you for creating such a fun place to escape too while traveling!!! Austin is still amazing and you'll definitely enjoy your stay here.",
