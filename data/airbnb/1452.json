  "text": "I had a wonderful experience staying at the Lotus House's library room. It's a special relaxing & lovely place for those looking for a rest and some personal downtime. After each hectic day in town I took a warm bath and sat in the sun room to soak in the incredible night view. Another favorite was practicing yoga in the morning while enjoying the garden view right outside your room. With Alyson out of town Max was always there when you need him while staying out of sight. I appreciate the little touches such as water bottles, coffee in the morning, snacks and cake, not to mention other incidentals this absent minded traveler forgot to bring. I sure look forward to stay here again (and longer) next time in Austin!",
