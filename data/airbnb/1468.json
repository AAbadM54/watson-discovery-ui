  "text": "Everything about our stay at the Lotus House was perfect!! It's a dream house! The place is artistic and beautifully decorated, clean, and Max went above and beyond - offering tea/ coffee/ bagels etc. He even sent a quick text daily asking if we needed anything which was so thoughtful. It was quiet and serene. I can wait to stay again and would recommend it to anyone visiting Austin- what a gem! We could even walk back and forth from downtown! Thank you! Geralyn",
