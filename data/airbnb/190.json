  "text": "Dorina was such an amazing host form the very begging she responded immediately to emails and questions. The moment you arrive she checks in with you to make sure everything is okay. The apartment is located a short walk to the subway station which is about 30-40 minutes to midtown Manhattan. The apartment is brand new tastefully decorated, feels both spacious and cozy. It's a nice and quiet neighborhood which gives you a feeling of belonging. The sushi place in metropolitan is highly recommended or the Italian restaurant nearby is very good as well. \r\nThe kitchen is stocked with the breakfast necessities and you have all the necessary pots and pans to cook as well if you feel like. \r\nIt was a short and delightful stay and anyone who's in luck to find availability is lucky to be Dorina's guest!",
