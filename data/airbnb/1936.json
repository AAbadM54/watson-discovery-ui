  "text": "This appartment was really cozy, nice, friendly and we loved our stay. They cleaned up nicely and let us use the facilities as much as we need. A quiet and open neighbourhood on just a 10 minute bike ride away from the city centre. Couldn't wish for a better introduction to both Austin and AirBNB... Thanks Lena!",
