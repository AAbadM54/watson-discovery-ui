  "text": "Excellent place to stay in Austin.convenient location, very clean, cozy, well/modern decorated and with very comfortable beds. Kitchen fully equipped, enough bath towels and even empty closets to hang your clothes. Nice  large flat TV  in living room, also two very cozy leather sofas.  The house is surrounded by beautiful trees. 3 minute walk to the pool (inside the condominium green area). Ideal for a family getaway. Dallas is a great host and was even available to take care of us during an emergency. We were extremely lucky to have found this place! We even had some complimentary drinks ;). Please note that  it had available  two private and spacious bedrooms. There is another semiprivate medium size room with no door, but worked just fine for us. the house has another bedroom but it was closed/not available.",
