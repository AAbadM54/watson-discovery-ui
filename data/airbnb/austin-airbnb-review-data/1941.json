  "text": "Michael is a nice person. Good communication ahead of our scheduled visit, was around when we needed something, and also respected our privacy. This house is located in a safe neighbourhood, and the backyard view is awesome. Linens and towels were provided, as well as internet and guest Netflix/Hulu account. I'll be in touch the next time I visit Austin!",
