  "text": "Joe’s house is beautiful, clean and cozy (just like in the pictures). We had a great time there during SXSW in March/2015 – it was the perfect place to relax after an overwhelming day in the event. We were a group of 3 people and each one had its own very comfortable bed/bathroom as described. Joe was very responsive and helped us when requested. This is highly recommended!",
