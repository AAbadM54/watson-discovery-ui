  "text": "Sydney was a great host, super responsive and accommodating. Her place was very clean and she had obviously gone to a lot of trouble to prepare for our arrival. Clean linens and towels were waiting for us as well as  a nice note with WiFi info. The apartment is located in a very nice quite part neighborhood with easy access to downtown Austin. Never paid more than $10 for an Uber / cab home.  Would absolutely stay here again.",
