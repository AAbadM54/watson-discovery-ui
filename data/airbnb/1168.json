  "text": "We had such a great time staying at Rene & Thomas' airstream. We booked about five days in advance and there was no delay in response. We were completely blown away by the airstream. Everything was clean and tidy. The theme is so fun and provided a nice little getaway for my girlfriend and me. We would definitely stay there during our next visit.",
