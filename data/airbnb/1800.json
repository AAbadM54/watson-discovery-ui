  "text": "If I could give Barbara 10+ stars I would. This was one of the best experiences we have ever had. We went to Austin to celebrate my Daughter's 30th Birthday and we could not have found a better home to celebrate it in. Barbara has thought of everything and her house is beautiful! The layout of the home is perfect and lots of privacy for everyone. We really enjoyed the pool and enjoyed grilling out. Her home is centrally located and it is in a great neighborhood. I really cannot say enough about her and her house. If you're going to Austin, rent her home. You will NOT be disappointed. Oh, and did I mention it was the most comfortable bed I have EVER slept in? Thank you again Barbara from all of us!!!",
