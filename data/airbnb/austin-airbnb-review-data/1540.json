  "text": "1st experience using Airbnb. Absolutely enjoyed my stay at Chulas.  I was profoundly comfortable within minutes after arrival. I enjoyed the master-bed room with the bathroom attached. Her home was kept tidy,  she's adaptable and most importantly personable. Couldn't believe she actually went out with  us, but she \"cant hang\"!  Ill definitely be back to stay with Chula. Ill most certainly recommend Airbnb and Chulas to friends and family who's traveling to austin in search of a cozy home and a pleasant host.",
