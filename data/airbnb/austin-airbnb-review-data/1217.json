  "text": "Renee and Thomas are soooo sweet! I absolutely loved walking into the Airstream with music playing and the Twinkie made my night!! It is so bright in there but there's a wonderful warm energy in that space. It is super comfy on the bed and waking up to birds chirping was a great wake up call. The house was about 8-10 steps away so going inside for the bathroom was no biggie. I love the entire mid-modern feel they were going for. Speaking with them and meeting their daughter, they have a knack for design AND hosting and I am just happy I could experience this while in Austin.",
