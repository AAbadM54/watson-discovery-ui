  "text": "Sue's condo was wonderful!  I did not want to leave!  The condo is very spacious and decorated nicely!  Very clean, bed was super comfortable and the location was perfect!  Love the neighborhood.\r\nIt is downtown, but it is very quiet.  I slept like a baby.  I had a lot of studying to do, and it was never a problem.  I had no problems at all during my stay.  Sue is a sweet, welcoming person.  There were plenty of snacks, and she was so helpful.  She was very communicative, and gave me excellent  information.  I am so glad I met her!\r\nI will definitely recommend Sue's condo to friends.  It is a fantastic place to stay and she is a delight.  Did I mention the fabulous artwork?  Great stay!  Thanks Sue!",
