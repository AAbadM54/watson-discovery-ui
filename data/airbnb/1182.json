  "text": "The airstream was everything I could have asked for and more! It was comfy and had a retro feel that took you back to the 50's. The location was perfect as it was close to downtown Austin and many of the cool bars and restaurants. The host, Thomas, was very helpful and recommended a bunch of local spots that turned out to be awesome! Would definitely recommend this place. Very unique and not to be missed.",
