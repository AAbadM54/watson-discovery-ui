  "text": "Great stay! Blaine made me feel welcome, offering to be there when I checked in and suggesting nearby restaurants and bars. The place was clean and spacious, in a nice quiet neighborhood. I was able to get work done at the big dining room table, and take a short drive or bike ride over all South Congress has to offer. I highly recommend staying here.",
