  "text": "Megan was responsive and very flexible with her schedule to meet our needs. Although the airbnb listing was for a private room, we had the apartment to ourselves for the long weekend. This made it extra easy. \r\n\r\nThe neighborhood was safe. But it was def further away from downtown then I had expected. Likely a 20-30 min walk. We uber-ed everywhere. That was very convenient and it was about $10 ride to downtown.",
