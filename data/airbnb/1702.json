  "text": "My mother, sister and nephew [1 years old] met me in Austin for Memorial Day and Anna's bungalow was perfect! It was so charming and the perfect size for my family - plenty of room for my nephew to run around as well! Anna was great at getting in touch with me and very accommodating to my family. Next time I need a place to stay in Austin, I will be checking with Anna first! Great price, perfect location and such a lovely place!",
