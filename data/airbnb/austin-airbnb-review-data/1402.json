  "text": "This was my first experience with airbnb and I couldn't have had a better host! Linda is, in one word, AWESOME! She welcomed us and immediately made us feel at home. She offered us breakfast  and made anything in her kitchen available to us. Linda even allowed my daughter to bake cupcakes and use all of her bakeware! The best part about our experience is that we have made a new friend in Austin! God bless Linda and her generous heart!",
