  "text": "If you stay at this place (which you should) check out Clarks oyster bar—right down the street and a quick walk. Seafood lovers rejoice! Now to the room—clean, quaint, comfortable, and a quick walk from shops and other restaurants. The water pressure was awesome (I know someone addressed that in a previous review) and the place fit us three girls comfortably. Sydney was super nice and available by text with any questions we had. The apartment complex is quiet and safe—perfectly suited for our girls weekend.",
