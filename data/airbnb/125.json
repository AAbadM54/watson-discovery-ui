  "text": "Lindsee was a great host, left us clear instructions about keys, local places to eat (all brilliant), and other helpful tips to.  The neighbourhood is safe, vibrant an is the best place to stay in New York. We love the East Village, its got a real community feel and has made our time in NY really special. The apartment is lovely, and a haven to come home to...would so recommend to anyone.",
