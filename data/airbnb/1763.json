  "text": "My group rented the sweet Casa So Co for a fun getaway bachelorette party and we loved everything about the house! The decor was so charming, inviting, and absolutely comfortable. I personally slept on the king-sized pull-out bed in the office room and I couldn't get over how much better I slept on it compared to my own bed. The main feature of the house was definitely the cute retro fridge! Everything about the house had wonderful personality. \r\n\r\nThe location was also perfect. The group easily was able to walk to local coffee shops and yummy restaurants and very delicious Gourdough's food truck twice for donuts. It was easily accessible to downtown, bars, and the airport. There's also a convenient market nearby to get your groceries at. We couldn't have chosen a better place to stay at. \r\n\r\nThe communication with Ashley and her property manager, Toni was so easy. They both are incredibly nice.  We had planned to make sangria but we couldn't find the bottle opener in the house, so Toni swung by with a bottle opener. They always answered every question we had and we are so grateful for their hospitality. \r\n\r\nThanks Casa So Co!",
