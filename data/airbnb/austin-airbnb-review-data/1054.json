  "text": "Julie and her husband were both so warm and welcoming. When I first arrived to the home everything was all set up and there were even some goodies in the fridge and wine on the counter for me! The house was more than enough room for myself and dog and also had a nice sized guest bedroom that worked well for when I had friends stay over. They even had a housekeeper come in to tidy up the place while I was at work every couple of weeks. It was awesome! I stayed for almost 5 months and couldn't have been happier with the location. It's in a cute, \"eclectic\" neighborhood with nice neighbors. Just far enough from downtown to where you can avoid traffic and have some peace at home but only a 5-10 min drive or Uber to the hot spots! The yard was especially great. I had my 70lb pup with me and he enjoyed it very much. I cannot thank Julie and David enough. They were both so thoughtful and kind, I look forward to staying with them in the future!",
