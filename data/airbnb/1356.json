  "text": "Ben is an excellent host that genuinely cares about his guests. He took our request at really short notice & we had good communication up to and during our stay. He provided us with many recommendations in Austin and also for our other destinations - everywhere we have been to has been a gem! Our stay was greatly enhanced by Ben's guidance, enthusiasm & hospitality.\nAs for the place, it's clean, comfortable and has plenty of space. It's in a great area and a short train ride to Downtown. Would definitely stay here again.",
