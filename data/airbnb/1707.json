  "text": "We loved staying at Anna's place! My friends and I visited during Austin City Limits, and the bungalow is super adorable and enough space for three adults. The backyard is the ultimate winner, with nice decor and lighting. Perfect for sitting outside and catching up with friends. The neighborhood is perfectly close to nice restaurants and coffee shops. Also great for a late evening run. Would totally stay here again next time I visit Austin.",
