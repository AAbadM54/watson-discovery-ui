  "text": "It was a perfect gateway for us! My partner and I had always stayed around Downtown on the previous visits; but we were delighted to find such a charming neighbourhood. The bungalow was exactly as described - cute and comfortable! Lots of useful information is provided to help the guests settle. The location is superb (especially for those travelling without a car) - 3 mins walk to the nearest bus stop and less than 10 mins stroll to the local restaurants, cafes and supermarket. Amanda and Dunstan were really helpful and prompt at responding to our requests. All in all it was a great start to our Airbnb experience! And, we look forward to staying with Amanda and Dunstan again on our next visit!",
