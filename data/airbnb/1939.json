  "text": "The house was as gorgeous as advertised and we loved our stay there! Laura made sure we had all the information we needed before we arrived, and then helped us out when we had any questions about the house. There was everything we needed in the house, and it was very comfortable! The big garage was a nice surprise as well, as we did not know that was going to be there when we booked! The house was clean and perfect, couldn't have asked for a better house/host!",
