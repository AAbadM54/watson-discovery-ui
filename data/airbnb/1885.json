  "text": "My husband and I had a lovely one night stay in Brett's sparkling clean treetop apartment. It was quiet and comfortable and had everything we needed - nice towels, super comfortable bed and Netflix on the big screen. Great wifi, hot water and a full kitchen made it perfect. We also appreciated the dedicated parking spot and the neighborhood is lovely old Austin - close to UT and downtown. We will return!",
