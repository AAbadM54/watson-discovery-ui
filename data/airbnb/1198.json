  "text": "We really enjoyed our stay in Rene's airstream. It was very clean and cozy and worked out great for our 4 nights in Austin. Rene met us at the house when we arrived and made sure we had no problems settling in. We were able to use the house, including access to kitchen, bath and garage. It was convenient and fun, almost like camping in the backyard like kids do! We would stay there again!",
