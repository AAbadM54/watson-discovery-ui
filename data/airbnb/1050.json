  "text": "Charles has a very nicely renovated house. I stayed there with 3 friends during our time at SXSW. The house is more spacious than the photos give it credit. Eventhough there is one bed, we had space for an air mattress. The kitchen served to be useful as well. Great location for our daily downtown commute.",
