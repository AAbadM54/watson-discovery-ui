  "text": "We stayed at Sue's Austin suite for a shared anniversary weekend and it was an amazing choice! The apartment was clean and very comfortable for two couples; we are very close friends so sharing one bathroom was no issue (Big bathroom, BTW). Very nicely decorated and has all the basic things you'll find at a hotel but you feel like you were staying at a friend's house. Sue was available for suggestions and to answer any questions we had. We highly recommend her place and will definitely come back next time we're in Austin.",
