  "text": "We were a little in shock when we arrived. The pictures make it look so open and light and welcoming, we were expecting a really nice apartment complex or condo. The place is actually a converted motel, and it doesn't look nearly as high end as the pictures make it seem. She did a great job with the place but it was still a little hard to get over. The place is in a great neighborhood with fun restaurants and stuff nearby and a short ride into sixth. Sydney was great to work with. I hate to sound negative but I think people should know about the complex itself, as we likely would have chosen another spot if we had known.",
