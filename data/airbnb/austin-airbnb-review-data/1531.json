  "text": "Melissa made it an easy transition to get into the house and she was able to get us into the house early that day, which worked out great. The guys has a great time and we had fun with the corn hole game that she provided us with. The house is a 20 minute drive to downtown and Barton springs pool. We didn't have a problem getting an UBER from this location as well which made it easy to get to downtown Austin.",
