  "text": "Great place and comfortable, lots of room,  was really cool to do some work in the streamline when it was raining too, felt very old school. Highly recommend it if you like having your own space completely. Because it separated from the house, I did feel bad walking through the house with wet shoes all those days. But I swept and cleaned up the wet leafs.",
