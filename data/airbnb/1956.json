  "text": "My friends and I really enjoyed the cottage that Emily rented us for the night.  It is very easy to find, right off I-35.  We walked in and everything was set up as pictured from the website.  Emily was a great host and left everything ready for us prior to move-in.  The house is in a quiet neighborhood, great location, about 2 miles from Downtown.  Awesome time in Austin, thanks to Emily and her great stay.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for anyone's stay in Austin... fyi... ACL is coming up. ;)",
