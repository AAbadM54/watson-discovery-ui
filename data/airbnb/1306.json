  "text": "Julie's home was beautiful and very cozy. The bed itself is a minor miracle--so ridiculously comfortable. The home is located in a very nice neighborhood and is within walking distance of many restaurants and stores. Also not that far from downtown. She was incredibly nice and easy to coordinate with. I highly recommend staying here, would do it again next time we're in Austin.",
