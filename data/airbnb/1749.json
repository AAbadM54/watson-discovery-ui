  "text": "My girlfriends and I had a fantastic stay at Casa Soco! The house is not only well-appointed (fully-stocked kitchen, washer/dryer, comfortable beds, large common space, plenty of bath linens) but you can tell a lot of thought and attention-to-detail went into designing a cute and welcoming space. I love the vintage Texas vibe that Ashley incorporates throughout the property. Also, you cannot beat the location! The house bikes were our main mode of transportation and we were able to ride all around the south congress neighborhood and beyond with no trouble at all. Ashley was super accommodating and made sure we had everything we needed before, during and after our stay. I would highly recommend this house to anyone visiting Austin. We have already discussed coming back next year! Thanks Ash!",
