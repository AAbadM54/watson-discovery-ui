  "text": "I was in New York over a long weekend for work, and this was the perfect crash-pad for myself and a friend. The place is immaculate and updated, in a quiet part of BedStuy and close to the subway. Very comfortable, and though I had packed all the snacks and toiletries I needed, there was everything in the unit you might need over a few days. Not a place to hang out in or have a party, but a cool neighborhood and great space to hang you hat between things.",
