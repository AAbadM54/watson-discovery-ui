  "text": "I loved loved loved Renee and Thomas' Airstream. I've rarely stayed in such a quaint and comfortable space. There's plenty of room and the shared bath was no problem at all. Renee was a perfect host who was there for me whenever I had questions. Location (with a car) is great--close to everything but tucked away just enough to be quiet at night. I'll certainly book with them again!",
