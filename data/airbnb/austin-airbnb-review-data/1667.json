  "text": "Ayn was wonderfully accommodating. She gave us a list of all of the best places to eat, shop and see and all of her recommendations were perfect. \r\n\r\nThe house itself was impeccably clean and cute as a button. It was the perfect retreat for my coworkers and me. The house is walking distance to all of the food cart trucks on 1st St. and also close to all the shops on South Congress and restaurants on Lamar. \r\n\r\nI would stay here again in a heartbeat the next time I'm in Austin. Thanks Ayn and Sebastian!",
