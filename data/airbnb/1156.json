  "text": "This is a great house for SXSW. It's an easy, 20 minute walk in to town. Great for professional sharers: I was staying with my colleague and the fact that it has one en suite upstairs and one downstairs meant that we each had the benefit of our own space, while still staying together and having a communal lounge to hangout in. The house was clean, cute, and the wifi worked. All very seamless and convenient. Thanks!",
