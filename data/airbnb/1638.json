  "text": "Dallas is fantastic.  He provided excellent details before and during our stay, he frequently checked in on us, and provided some great suggestions. I'll have to make it back to Austin to do the night time swim at Barton to see the stars and fewer people.\r\n\r\nOur group of 6 women were very comfortable in the space.  The condo has nice showers and beds and we enjoyed the community pool.\r\n\r\nThanks for having us over, Dallas!",
