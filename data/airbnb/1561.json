  "text": "Note: This is my first AirBNB experience.\r\n\r\nAfter initially being rejected last minute by another AirBNB location, we found this place. It was actually a very good thing as Dallas' place was far superior.\r\n\r\nFive of us came down to Austin for SXSW and we all fit comfortably (2 couples and a single). The house was clean, spacious and came pre-stocked with a 24 pack of Lone Star. We run the social beer network Untappd, so we appreciated this perk! There we no complaints about the beds (I know the one I slept on was extremely comfortable). Did I mention that the place was spacious? It's a modern townhouse with very comfortable couches. The artwork hung throughout is also very very awesome - wanted to take a couple home! \r\n\r\nThe neighborhood is very quiet. It's about a 5 minute drive from down town or a 15-20 minute bus ride (which one of our guys did several times with no trouble). It was good to be able to get away from the madness of downtown during SXSW and relax.\r\n\r\nDallas was very responsive to texts and was very accommodating, making sure everyone made it into town and that everything with the townhouse was to our liking.\r\n\r\nI'd definitely stay here again next time I head to Austin. Thank you so much for the great time.",
