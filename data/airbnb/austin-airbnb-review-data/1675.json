  "text": "This was our first trip to Austin and we completely 'lucked' out finding the Sparrow House.  The house is charming, beautifully decorated and super clean.  Ayn and Sebastian were very proactive hosts, checking in with us during our stay to make sure all was OK and that we had all we needed.  It almost felt like we had a personal concierge.  Their recommendations for restaurants were spot on and led us to Barley Swine which is a treat not to be missed.  We would come back to Sparrow House in a heartbeat.  Thanks Ayn and Sebastian!",
