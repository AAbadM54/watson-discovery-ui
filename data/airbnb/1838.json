  "text": "Blaine and his roommate Marissa provided the basics to facilitate our budget conscious explorations of Austin.  The arrangement has changed a bit since the photos were taken for his initial profile post, but there is still a guest room and bed, WiFi, linens, kitchen and laundry access.  Blaine's communication was timely and helpful, and, while our paths barely crossed, he was a courteous and unobtrusive host.  Since the location is close to a few different bus routes (including a Night Owl route), we were able to explore Austin without a car.    Bicycles are another transportation option we attempted, but had bad luck with flats and basic maintenance issues.  Those traveling by car will find this location very convenient to Interstate 35.",
