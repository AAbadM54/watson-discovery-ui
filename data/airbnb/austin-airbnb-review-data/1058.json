  "text": "We LOVED Alex's place. It was a nice quiet neighborhood close to downtown and everywhere that we needed to go! The house is clean and eclectic and we enjoyed our stay so much.  Alex was great about checking in and making sure that we were taken care of and even left us a bottle of wine for us to find upon our Arrival. It was a great price and a great trip!",
