  "text": "Benjy was a great host, and would communicate things to me in advance. He was friendly during my stay and would chat with me if there was time. The room was clean and had a homey feeling. The location was convenient for food and transportation as well. I had a great stay at his place, and would recommend it (especially for ACL or SXSW, etc).",
