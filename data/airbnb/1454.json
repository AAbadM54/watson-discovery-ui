  "text": "Hi had a really great time in Austin and felt very lucky to have found the Lotus House. Alyson and Max were great hosts and made sure I had everything I needed. There were fresh flowers throughout the rooms and they gave me a lot of extra food so that my grocery shopping was cut in half. The proximity to Barton Springs and the hike n bike trail was awesome. A great retreat for those interested in running, swimming, biking, and yoga.",
