  "text": "My boyfriend and I stayed here when visiting Austin on a Friday night. Being from Portland, OR this quaint and vintage cottage fit our liking well. The home is older but has a cozy feel, it is away from the hustle and bustle but still close enough to experience the city. It's a private and secluded lot, if you're looking for something fancy and modern, this isn't for you. \nJonathan and Carly provided well written instructions, were very responsive and were nice enough to let our dog stay. There was a lovely piano, and books everywhere. This was our first Airbnb experience and we enjoyed the stay.",
