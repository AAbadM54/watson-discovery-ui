  "text": "Wonderful Stay!  Megan did a great job of keeping me informed and giving me directions.  She and Dave and their dog Lucy are great hosts and very relaxed.  The room is cozy with a good futon like mattress, and a window for fresh air.  The apt is well updated and very clean.  They even had toiletries, guest bottle of water and microwave popcorn-better than a hotel.  Easy to find in a hip neighborhood.  Will stay there again.",
