  "text": "Connor was an awesome guest! He made our stay at Austin even better than what we expected! He was really kind and made us feel just at home! We even stuck around to play guitar and sing with him.\r\n\r\nBus is literally less than 2 minutes walking, so no need for uber or taxi.\r\n\r\nWould definitely return to this airbnb whenever I come back.",
