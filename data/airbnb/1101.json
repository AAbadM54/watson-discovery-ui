  "text": "We rented the bedroom from Robin and Mike for one night in Austin. They are a super nice couple and made us feel at home with a cup of tea waiting for us and tips for enjoying the city. The house is on a quiet residential street and about a 15 minute walk from South Congress Ave, where there are lots of interesting shops and restaurants. Overall a positive experience and they made us feel very welcome.",
