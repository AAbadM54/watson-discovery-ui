  "text": "Megan was flexible and met us at the apartment to hand off the key, we then had the apartment to ourselves for the entire weekend.  This was a great home base for ACL, it was ~2 mile bike ride to the festival grounds, and there was a bike rack near Megan's unit.  Downtown was easily accessible, only about 1 mile to Kung Fu.",
