  "text": "The bungalow was perfect. My wife and I were there for a few days and found it very comfortable. Towards the end of our stay, our plans changed and I ended up having to stay even longer, and Anna was highly accommodating. It was a great stay, a comfortable and clean house, and I would recommend it without a doubt.",
