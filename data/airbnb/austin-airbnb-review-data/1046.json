  "text": "Chris was an excellent host. He was very friendly and provided my friend and I with everything we needed. The place was very clean and modern, not to mention close to lots of great restaurants and bars. The complex had a variety of great amenities as well. If you're seeing a show at Emo's Austin, look no further. I would definitely stay with Chris if I find myself in this neighborhood of Austin again.",
