  "text": "Fabulous.  We rented our house in Central Austin and needed somewhere to stay in Austin for a few days.  We found Melissa and Troy and rented their Studio.  It was Perfect and hopefully we will be staying again.  As an Architect and Builder I would say that they have done an amazing and tasteful job renovating the house and I would highly recommend either the Studio, House or both.\r\nMelissa and Troy were both great on a personal level and have a very friendly dog that enjoyed playing with out friends dog when they came to visit.",
