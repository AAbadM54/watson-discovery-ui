  "text": "We had a wonderful stay in Brett's condo, I loved drinking coffee on the balcony in the morning! It is a great place, very tastefully decorated (my partner is on the hunt to find some of the great furniture that Brett has) and incredibly comfortable.  We are looking forward to staying here again next time we are in Austin.",
