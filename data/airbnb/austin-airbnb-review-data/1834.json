  "text": "This is definitely the best deal in Austin. You have an entire house to yourself, at a very low price. The kitchen and bathroom have everything, plus more than you could ever need. The towels were plush and plentiful (a serious rarity among airbnb places), and the kitchen had all the goodies you could ever need. It is conveniently located walking distance to a cafe, massage place and the freeways. Light sleepers will need to wear ear plugs, but if you are normal (like my husband), you will have no problem falling asleep on the cushy beds.",
