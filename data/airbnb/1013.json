  "text": "The listing description couldn't have been more accurate. It really is about just a 10min drive away from Downtown, meaning a very affordable Uber ride. This bungalow is located in a quiet, but friendly, neighborhood in Austin. It was very clean and cozy, perfect for a girls weekend. The hosts weren't in town, but we were able to meet someone who was dogsitting for them and he was really helpful in suggesting places to eat in the area. Having stayed in the noisy South Congress area before, I would much rather stay in Hyde Park any day. If I come back to Austin, I would come back to this bungalow!",
