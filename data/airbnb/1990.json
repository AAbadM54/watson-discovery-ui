  "text": "I had a truly wonderful stay: very accurate condo description with a very hospitable, gracious host! Marc kindly picked me up from the airport (he offered!), and even offered to drop me off at the SxSW convention center! Super close to downtown area, and several convenient eateries. Marc was super helpful in every way, suggested places to eat, kept the fridge stocked with waters, and guided my way through the condo village. His unit is totally \"smart\" too, with auto-lighting and such, with awesome WiFi and Netflix/AppleTV hooked up to enjoy. The condo is beautifully furnished, and super quiet--perfect after a long day at SxSW! Highly recommend and would stay here again.",
