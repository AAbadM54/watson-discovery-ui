  "text": "This house far exceeded expectation. It was absolutely perfect for our group and Missy was the perfect host. I really cannot rave about the experience anymore. It's necessary to have a car if you want to go back and forth between the house and downtown, but you could spend the whole trip at the house and be content! I would book again in an instant and HIGHLY recommend this house. Everything was PERFECT!",
