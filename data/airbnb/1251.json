  "text": "Tri was a great host! He was very friendly and answered any questions promptly. The room is very simple---just a bed and a lamp, but comfortable nonetheless. The kitchen is small, but easily workable, and Tri left plenty of space in the fridge. The bathroom does not have outlets (I think? I did not see any at least) so bring a small mirror if you use an electric shaver or whatever electronic mirror-requiring device you may have. It is a short drive to get to downtown from the house. The area nearby is nice to walk around in as well. Overall we had a good experience here and would come back again.",
