  "text": "The room was great--very comfortable. Kitchen, washer and drier were easy to use and the sun room made me want to stay forever. On top of that, Alyson and Max were excellent hosts! Friendly, but respectful of privacy. This was my first airbnb experience and I couldn't imagine it going any better.",
