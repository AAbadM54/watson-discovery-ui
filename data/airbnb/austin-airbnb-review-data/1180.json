  "text": "I am so fortunate to have come across Rene and her AIRSTREAM! I was in search of a place for my daughter and her best friend to stay for a weekend.  Rene is the kindest and caring soul. Each and every time I messaged her, she responded in such a fast and timely manner. In my book you can not find a better host! The AIRSTREAM was the perfect quaint spot for the girls. They had a awesome experience!!! Thanks to Rene this trip turned out superb! I look forward to renting from her in the future!",
