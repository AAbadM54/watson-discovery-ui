  "text": "This was my boyfriend and I's first AirBNB experience, and we were nothing short of blown away. The house was immaculate yet cozy, the neighborhood pretty and peaceful, and our hosts welcoming and accommodating throughout our entire stay. They even let us bring our two big dogs! They did little things that made all the difference. They stocked the kitchen with particular coffee per request, and left us an anniversary spread of chocolate and wine + flutes in our room! To top it off, Sommer and Dan were so friendly I'd book again just to come hang out and get to know them better. Five stars all the way!",
