  "text": "A charming home on a secluded street. Quirky decor made for a fun vibe! Big, quiet backyard, perfect for relaxing. A selection of nice toiletries and fluffy towels were a welcome luxury. Ayn and Sebastian went above and beyond in making us feel at home, fielding our numerous questions about Austin and the accommodations with detail and care. The house was very clean, but did have a noticeable musty smell which persisted throughout our stay (though open windows helped).",
