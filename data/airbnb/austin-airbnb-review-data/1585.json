  "text": "Dallas was an excellent host. Very helpful, super nice and responsive. You probably want to rent a car but buses are close and cabs are not very expensive (need to call them and give them some time - we recommend Al Shire (website hidden)). The house was very clean and comfortable. On behalf of our whole group, we would definitely recommend staying here. Thank you, Dallas!",
