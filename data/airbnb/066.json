  "text": "I had a great time at Kristen's apartment and she was a great host. The communication was easy and she met me at the apartment and gave me information about it and the neighborhood. The apartment is even better than the pictures. It's large, very clean, the bed was very comfortable, the kitchen well equipped and it's very quiet which is hard to find in NYC. I'm very familiar with the neighborhood which is close to the subway and about a 20 minute ride to midtown. There's a great large park nearby (Riverbank) that is good for jogging, has an Olympic sized swimming pool and a skating rink. There's also some good restaurants nearby. I was very happy with my stay here and I'd definitely stay here again!",
