  "text": "Brett was super awesome and helpful with logistics from the moment we made the reservation. Quick to respond via text and just a general pleasure to connect with. \r\n\r\nThe apartment was adorable. Absolutely perfect for our group of 3 attending the first weekend of ACL. The apt. is about a 2 mile walk to Zilker--we wound up using Uber/Lyft to get to and from and the cost was about $5 each way. \r\n\r\nApt. is 1-2 blocks from 2 different B-cycle (bike sharing) pick up points, 1 mile from downtown (and the flagship Whole Foods... holla!) Close to campus and on an adorable super quiet street. Also has every amenity you need--AC, full kitchen and bath, pull out couch, cozy bed, ironing board, etc.\r\n\r\nI couldn't recommend him or his place more highly--can't wait to come back again next year (fingers crossed!)",
