  "text": "My sister and i stayed in Rene and Thomas' trailer during a 5 day trip to Austin. It was super roomy and clean- and way more fun than staying in a hotel (and a lot cheaper!!). The house itself is equally charming - and we didn't have have other guests while we were there, which was nice because we also had the living room, bathroom and kitchen mostly to ourselves. A really charming place to stay! Only thing I would say is to make sure you have a car as it is in a residential area without much to walk to but is only a few minutes away from everything you'd want to do and see.",
