  "text": "We came to the bungalow for ACL and it was perfect for two couples. The space had everything we needed during the weekend and it was a really easy commute (we used a lot of Ubers) to the fest and to the downtown areas. We especially appreciated the leftover beers in teh fridge when we arrived - we paid it forward too! I'd definitely recommend staying here and we look forward to coming back on our next visit to ATX! :)",
