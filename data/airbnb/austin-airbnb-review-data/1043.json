  "text": "Martin was an awesome host. He made me feel at home since the very first day, always making sure I took advantage of the resources in town. \r\nThe house was clean, cozy and in super convenient location. Staying there was a blast of an experience. I felt I was part of a community, sharing cool insights with everyone or just having fun. I would definitely recommend to anyone involved in tech to stay with Martin.",
