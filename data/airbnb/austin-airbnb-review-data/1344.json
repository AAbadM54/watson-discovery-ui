  "text": "Jinny, is my 1st Air bnb experience.  She & her sidekick Daisy have set the standard for every experience from this point forth.  A very welcoming presence, comfortable environment, clean & accommodating.  Jinny took me under her wing & showed me her community.  Jinny's home is cute, comfy & quaint.  Jinny's hosting style is very personable & engaging yet non-intrusive.  I felt like, I was staying at friend of a friends home that I had never met, while I was in town on business & we hung out when we weren't working. I walked away from this experience feeling relaxed & inspired.  Kudos to Air bnb, Jinny is a great ambassador of your brand...",
