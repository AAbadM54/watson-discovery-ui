  "text": "This is a great Airbnb! It's clean, modern and well decorated. I feel like the hosts must be architects! \r\n\r\nThis place also has everything you could need, it's fully equipped and there are even little extra amenities such as a hairdryer, flat iron, etc. \r\n\r\nI would highly recommend this little gem in Austin. Will definitely stay again!",
