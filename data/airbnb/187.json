  "text": "The apartment was great. The metro stop was just a block away. Caroline's roommates were helpful and friendly. The room was upstairs next to the second bathroom. It had two large windows that got a lot of natural light, coupled with heavy curtains to black out the room if needed. Overall, Caroline's room was a great value for the area. I'd recommend it.",
