  "text": "Our experience was great. Ananda and Dunstun was very prompt in their responses, and did not mind us arriving from Houston later in the evening. The bungalow was clean and cute as described. Their listing really helped my boyfriend and I put into perspective what house size to search for in the future. We really like the short walking distance to Quacks bakery and our usual spots. Even though we only stayed one night, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.",
