  "text": "Sid was very accomadating and a great host!! His communication was awesome, and he was able to make sure I knew how to get to my interview with the map on his guest room door. His apartment was very clean, peaceful, and he gave me the keys as soon as I arrived and had clean sheets, a bath towel, and provided a very comfortable stay! I would definitely stay with Sid again, thanks so much for your hospitality man I really appreciate it!",
