  "text": "Oh wow did we have fun! My husband and I came to Austin for a little romantic get away and staying in the airstream was so perfect! It's so cute and stylized! They had beer and filter water in the fridge, fresh towels, microwaveable Mac and cheese and a Twinkie!!! Loved every second of it! The shared space in the house was not bad at all! Everyone was really cool and respectful. We are so inspired to get and airstream now! Totally recommend it!",
