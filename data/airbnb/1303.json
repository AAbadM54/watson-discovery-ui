  "text": "I cannot commend Julie enough here, but i'll keep it short.  She was a life saver on Thursday when we rented her place.  It was a last-minute deal and she did everything possible to accommodate us, even allowing us to get in early.  I was pleasantly surprised when she left us some iced coffee and trail mix, just for kicks.  The Cloud Palace is an adorable place and I would definitely stay there in the future. I really liked the table and chairs outside, it was a really beautiful, private place to sit and get some work done.  Can I give 5+ stars? She gets 5+ stars.",
