  "text": "This place was so spacious and comfortable to stay in. I came with 5 of my friends so we had more than enough room for all 6 of us. Dallas was very accommodating as far as responding to all of our questions and being flexible with our check in/out times. The location is pretty central to everything we wanted to do and if you have a car then everything was about 10-15 mins away including downtown. I'd recommend this place to anyone! I would definitely stay here again next time I visit Austin!",
