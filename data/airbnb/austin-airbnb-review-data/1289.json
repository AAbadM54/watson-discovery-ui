  "text": "Pam was very welcoming and hospitable! She provided us snacks and light food for breakfast, and even packed us food to go for our drives back home. My friend and I stayed there during ACL weekend, and Pam even offered to drop us off or pick us up from the festival. The location is clean, neat, and a perfect place for a weekend stay; super close to South Congress and a quick drive to downtown.",
