  "text": "We stayed at Emily's place for the latter part of SXSW. It was perfect for our group! It's close to the I-35 and public transportation (a short 10-15 single bus ride to downtwon), a grocery store, and a great little neighbourhood cafe and eatery (the Cherrywood Coffee House). Her place was bright (with many windows), tidy, has character, and was exactly as described. The back patio (with hammock) was fantastic and the neighbourhood has lots of nice newer and older houses. Emily has got the whole airbnb thing down to a science - she made this new (for us) experience extremely easy. I would definitely stay here again!",
