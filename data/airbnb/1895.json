  "text": "Staying at Brett's apartment was the perfect way to experience Austin. Not only was the apartment incredibly clean, organized, and cozy, but it had every amenity we could have possibly needed. \r\n\r\nAfter being on the road for a while, having things like an ironing board, washer and dryer with laundry detergent, shampoo and conditioner, a hair dryer - basic necessities that were in good condition - was so comforting and helpful. \r\n\r\nOn top of that, the apartment was decorated so nicely and really felt like home. We took full advantage of the balcony, the giant television, with Netflix and Pandora included - a lovely surprise - and the chilled mason jars in the freezer. Brett honestly thought of everything. And if we had any questions, he answered almost immediately. \r\n\r\nThe location of the spot was perfect as well. It was a ten minute drive from literally any place we wanted to go - restaurants, bars, shops, etc. When we wanted to go out to bars, an uber was at the building within three minutes tops. \r\n\r\nOverall, I have zero complaints. The apartment was the perfect space for myself and my three friends and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to spend some time in Austin.",
