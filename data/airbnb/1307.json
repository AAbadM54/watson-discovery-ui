  "text": "The place was as advertised. It was located in a very quiet and safe area in Hyde Park, one of the trendiest zones of Austin. \r\nThe apartment itself has hardwood floors and a nice decoration. The apartment was very well taken care of, and clean.\r\nThe host received me with homemade pizza (excellent, by the way) + a bottle of wine + chocolate. This was very nice on her.\r\nShe was extremelly nice and welcoming. I rate this place as excellent. I would definitely go back there again, and I highly recommend it.",
