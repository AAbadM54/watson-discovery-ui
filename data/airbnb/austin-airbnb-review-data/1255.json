  "text": "The location is great, just a few blocks north of UT's campus. I was able to walk everywhere I wanted to go. The room is basic, just a bed and a small nightstand, but has plenty of space. The rest of Tri's place has everything you need. I didn't see Tri much, but we was a very nice guy and checked multiple times if I had everything I needed. I would stay here again.",
