  "text": "Val was very nice and welcoming! She gave me great suggestions for when I wanted to ride a bike or rent a kayak. The house was very quiet, quaint cottage. You have the guest room to the right. Clean and cozy! Bed was comfortable too. Shared bathroom which was fine for 1 nite. Overall great !!",
