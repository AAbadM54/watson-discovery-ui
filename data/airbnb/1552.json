  "text": "I'd like to thank Brandon and his wife for making our first Formula 1 Race experience even better than we imagined.  The home is absolutely beautiful and views of Austin are amazing.  Brandon was very accommodating to our schedules in both check in and check out times.  Their modern home is so warm, inviting and literally 15 min from downtown Austin.  This is my first AirBnb experience and thanks to Brandon, this will not be me last.  We already told him that we'll be returning next year!  A very Easy 5 star review and I would tell my friends/family this is the home to rent in Austin!",
