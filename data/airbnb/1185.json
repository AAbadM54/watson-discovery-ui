  "text": "Our experience in Rene and Thomas' Airstream was excellent! The trailer was clean and inviting upon arrival, as were the common areas of the house. The experience is very unique and we loved our time there! Only blemish on an otherwise fantastic stay was that the mood lighting in the Airstream wasn't working.",
