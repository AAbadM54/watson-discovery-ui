  "text": "My husband and I stayed at the Lotus House for 3 days and found it to be a very relaxing and comfortable accommodation.  Alyson and Tyler were helpful, laid back hosts. It should be noted that the house is located in a very hilly neighbourhood, and is a 15-20min walk to the nearest main street. With a rental car this would be fine but on foot or by bike, this is a bit challenging.",
