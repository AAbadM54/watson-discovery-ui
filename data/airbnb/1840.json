  "text": "Blaine and this place were great. Very friendly and hospitable. The room was as seen. The location was great for Austin because there was a bus stop that 3 mins from Blaine's place that took you directly downtown and back for only $2. \r\n\r\nThe only negative of the place was that the house had a giant dog (some sort of poodle/doberman/cujo mix) that wasn't particularly friendly. However, Blaine and the roommates quickly removed the dog whenever I was around. \r\n\r\nThe place is a great value and exactly what I was looking for on this trip.",
