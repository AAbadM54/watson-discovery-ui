  "text": "Dallas provided a nice, clean condo that accomodated 7 adults comfortably. He was very courteous and and prompt in responding to our questions. The beds were great.  The bathrooms and kitchen were very clean.  The big screen was perfect for the World Cup.  The location was GREAT, quiet but close to wonderful restaurants, shops, parks, etc. We had a terrific time!",
