  "text": "This house is GREAT.  Amazing back yard with an amazing pool.  The inside is really set up to comfortably sleep 8 in the main house and 2 in the separate apartment (2 queens and 4 single bunks in the main house, 1 queen in the apartment).  Then in addition to this, there  are 2 couches in the living room, 1 couch in the master bedroom, and 1 couch in the apartment.  Dana was amazing and helped us so much.  Neighborhood is amazing.  Dana even stocked the fridge with drinks.  Listing was accurate, would have liked more clear description that the 4th bedroom was separated from the main house and that the entrance for that was in the rear.",
