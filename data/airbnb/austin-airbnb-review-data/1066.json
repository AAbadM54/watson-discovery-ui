  "text": "This apartment was charming and well-presented clean and well-appointed, Courtney was prompt, polite, and helpful in replying to our messages, she provided us with lists of personal recommendations for things to do, restaurants, cafes, bars, perfect guide to local knowledge, the apartment is quiet and secluded, with a very private balcony almost in the trees. We loved her travelling decor, it was like staying in a friend's place, instead of the anonymous hotels and motels we've stayed at in Austin before. An easy place to find, and less than 15 minutes from the heat of Austin, 5 minutes to South Congress, perfect.",
