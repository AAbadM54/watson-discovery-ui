  "text": "Tri and Jon were very kind. I felt welcomed in their home. The apartment is really, really nice and they allowed me to use the kitchen and to watch their cool Apple TV. The room is good and it was relatively clean. Perhaps a small wardrobe or anywhere to hang clothes would be good, but overall it was an excellent deal. From the area downtown Austin is very accessible with buses, cabs or Uber. I would strongly recommend a stay at Tri's.",
