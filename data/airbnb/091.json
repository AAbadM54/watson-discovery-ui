  "text": "Alan and Ruth's home was as described in the listing and more! The neighborhood was very quiet and safe. I had no issues walking around the neighborhood in the wee hours of the night. The apartment decor was amazing and we loved the old American flag in the living room. The proximity to the train station was another plus. L train stop is one block away and it was extremely convenient to head into Manhattan or around other parts of Brooklyn. I highly recommend staying at Alan and Ruth's Place to anyone.",
