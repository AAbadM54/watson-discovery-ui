  "text": "Max was was very friendly, accommodating and hospitable. Very clean bathroom and bedroom! Had access to the kitchen, living room and open area of the house! The room was great, as was the outside area. Also, had a place to park our car off the street! Will definitely stay again!\r\n\r\nNote: If you're going for ACL, it is in walking distance (1.6 miles) but it's a very hilly walk! Doable, just be prepared because the bicycle taxis will not go up the hill(s) :)",
