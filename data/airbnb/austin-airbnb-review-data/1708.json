  "text": "Very comfortable for 2 couples that shared it. Kitchen and bathroom are a simple modern and functional design. Front and back yards  were attractively landscaped. Located in a fun neighborhood, but also easy access to roads leading downtown. Would definitely recommend to anyone, and we would return in a heartbeat.",
