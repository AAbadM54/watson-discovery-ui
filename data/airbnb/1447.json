  "text": "Alyson and Max were perfect hosts. Max leaves a pump thermos of delicious coffee on the kitchen counter early each morning. The house is very comfortable and sunny. The room with the attached bath is spacious; the bed is very comfortable.  The location is on a quiet street, but near downtown and the Austin action. We will definitely try to stay here again.",
