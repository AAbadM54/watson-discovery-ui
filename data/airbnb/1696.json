  "text": "My two girlfriends and I had planned a weekend retreat in Austin together, and were looking for the right place to stay. Anna's charming house was exactly what we were hoping for! A wonderfully remodeled home in a quiet neighborhood just a few minutes from downtown Austin..... A modern kitchen in which to prepare delicious meals together, and an absolutely gorgeous backyard to enjoy the meals. We are so thankful for the comfy bedding, the clean and bright bathroom, and how uncluttered and tastefully decorated the entire home is. Thank you Anna! We would recommend you and your hospitable home to anyone visiting Austin!",
