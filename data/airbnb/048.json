  "text": "What a great little find in such a good location. Private room was perfectly equipt for a fun weekend and the 24hr reception a blessing. Grabbed dinner in kitchn on Friday as I had to do some work and the pasta was lovely. You could hear the club slightly in the bathroom but hardly in the bedroom and had no trouble sleeping at all. Looking forward to coming back in the summer and using the garden and sun loungers. An oasis of value in Manhattan.",
