  "text": "I couldn't have asked for a better first experience with Airbnb. Sue not only treated my friends and I as weekend guest, but more like her family that had came to visit Austin for the first time. She's very knowledgeable of Austin and has great recommendations for great local scenes. She has an amazing home, very clean, well equip with daily essentials, and beautiful views of Austin from the balcony. The home could not have been located in a better spot, walking distance to the center of Austin and other iconic landmarks in Austin. Make sure to check out the food truck across the street for breakfast tacos and late night tacos. I can't wait to visit Austin again and Sue will definitely be the first one I reach out to for accommodations. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nAlvand/Jamie/Daniel",
