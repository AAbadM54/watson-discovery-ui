  "text": "The only only thing more magnificent than the attention to detail and extraordinary consideration of Julie is her smile and charm upon first meeting.  Julie went out of the way to make my stay here feel special, including a bottle of red wine and bar of chocolate set out upon arrival.  The simple beauty of the space is obviously well thought in regard to warm light and refined lack of clutter.  I really enjoyed the loftiest bed I could have been lucky enough to score, complete with fine cotton sheets and down comforter.  Julie even stocked the fridge with items for breakfast, including eggs, granola, fruit, and coffee!!  OTT, Over the top!!  My getaway was just what I needed in the quiet neighborhood of Hyde Park, super near Guadalupe St. (aka the 'Drag'), home to plentiful shops and food and music venues and such.  I highly recommend staying in Julie's sweet space if you appreciate finer things and want to meet one of the cooler people around!  Oh, and for those who enjoy plants and water, this place is sweet with abundant plant life that leave the air crisp and a Berkey water filter! Approve!",
