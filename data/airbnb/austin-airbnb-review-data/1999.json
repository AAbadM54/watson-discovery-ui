  "text": "Chad was super flexible, responsive and able to help us a last minute stay for our final night in Austin. He was great at keeping in contact with me and offered a great place to stay! Super clean, comfortable, and with a great view! Enjoyed watching the sunset off his balcony as our trip to Austin completed. Would certainly stay here again!",
