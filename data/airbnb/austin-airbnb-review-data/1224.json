  "text": "We loved staying in this little gem while on our anniversary, it has charm to spare and if you are a photographer you will especially love the details. The weather was pretty rough part of the time we were there with torrential downpours and flooding in other areas and we really appreciated our hosts checking in on us to make sure we were ok during that time. When we first got there the pillows on our bed weren't enough support for my husbands bad back and they immediately helped us get some different ones. \nWe would come back in a heartbeat!",
