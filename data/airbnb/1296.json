  "text": "Julie's place was fantastic! It is nestled in our favorite neighborhood in Austin.  Its easy walking distance to many of our favorite places including Quacks, Ruby's BBQ, Chango's, Wheatsville Grocery store, Spiderhouse, and much more!\r\nThe apartment is a beautiful space tastefully outfitted with antique furniture and interesting art. The bed is a supremely comfortable memory foam mattress and pillows.  On top of this, Julie left many very nice supplies for us to use for our stay including a bottle of wine, nice bath soaps and breakfast supplies.  Our experience far exceeded my expectations and I would definitely recommend her place to anyone looking to visit Austin.",
