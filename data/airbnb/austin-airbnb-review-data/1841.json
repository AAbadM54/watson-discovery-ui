  "text": "I loved staying at Blaine's house. I felt incredibly welcomed and comfortable my whole stay, Blaine was such a wonderful host. He was really understanding with my inconsistent and last minute communication while organising my stay with him, which I really appreciated.  He was incredibly open and went out of his way to make sure I was enjoying myself, often feeding me and making me yummy drinks. Rufus is the sweetest dog ever and he makes the house a home. The place overall is really warm and welcoming with furniture made my Blaine himself, which is awesome. This was my favourite ever stay and I would highly recommend it.",
