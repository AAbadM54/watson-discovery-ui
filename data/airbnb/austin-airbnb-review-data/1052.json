  "text": "Our stay in Austin at Julie's was wonderful! She welcomed us with a 6 pack of local beer and some snacks. She also provided us with a list of some local places to eat. We tried the breakfast tacos she suggested and they were quite tasty! The house was neat and clean and a great place to stay. It was in a good and convenient location also. She was always available to answer any questions we had and made sure that we enjoyed our stay! Overall, great weekend trip and a great place to stay!",
