  "text": "Although I didn't get to meet Erica in person she definitely made us feel welcomed and was a great host! Erica was always just a text or phone call away if needed. The apartment is just the way it looks in the pictures and is very cozy and perfect. The location is walking distance to pretty much anywhere you want to go and there is a bus stop right in front of the building, as well as a subway station down the street. I loved the location, there were definitely plenty of places to eat and Erica had a blow dryer and plenty of shampoo options to choose from in the Apt (Def a plus for any woman). Awesome stay, had a great time!",
