  "text": "My boyfriend, Kaleb, and I made a last minute trip to Austin to celebrate as a late birthday present. I was extremely grateful that Blaine responded as quickly as he did. Although we didn't get to meet Blaine, our stay was overall ok. The majority of the house was very clean, like the kitchen area and the living room, which were both very comfortable and cozy. But upon entering the room, we found a dead roach near the bedside table. We decided to overlook it because hey, bugs happen. However, there were also a good amount of spiderwebs and little bugs all around the window near the shower, which didn't make us feel like we were expected. I understand our reservation was made the day before, but that should have given him more than enough time to double check to make sure things were clean. \nThe bed was incredibly stiff (my boyfriend thinks the best word is \"ungodly\" stiff) and even though the towels may have been clean, they were very stained. I'm not sure we will be back, but it was a good last minute thing.",
