  "text": "Dallas was an excellent host.  He is very easy to communicate and coordinate with.  I stayed there with 5 friends visiting from the UK and it was perfect in many ways:  big enough to accommodate us all, flexible check-in and check-out times, excellent location to everything and everywhere, stocked kitchen, great layout, pool, tennis courts, etc.  Dallas left a case of beer for us and the place was just as represented. I would highly recommend renting Dallas' place and will do so again myself if needed again in Austin.",
