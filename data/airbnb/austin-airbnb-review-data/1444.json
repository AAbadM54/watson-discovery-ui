  "text": "So Alyson and Max are the perfect hosts.  Just the right touch of being friendly combined with the ability to give and create space.  The house is very nice and contains the world's cutest cat.  In terms of location it's an 8 minute drive to downtown and close to Barton Springs when they reopen. \r\n\r\nPlenty of awesome places to eat and South Congress is a delight to stroll down.  The chocolate chip cookies at Jo's are terrific.  And when offered to attend one of Alyson's yoga classes, go.  She's a terrific teacher.",
