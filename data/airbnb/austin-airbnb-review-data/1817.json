  "text": "Jonathan and Carly were wonderful hosts.  They provided instructions for self check-in, followed up the next two days and made sure we had everything we needed.  The house is in a beautiful, historic neighborhood, and is walking distance to Lake Austin, convenient to downtown, and all the attractions just west of downtown.  The property backs up to a beautiful greenbelt and creek running parallel to Mopac.",
