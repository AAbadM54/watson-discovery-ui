  "text": "I recently stayed at the Lotus House for SXSW and couldn't have had a better experience. This was my first time booking a trip through Airbnb and it did not disappoint. Alyson was very sweet and easy to work with. The house is conveniently located, close to downtown Austin. The room and bathroom were clean, which is a must. Overall it was all that I could have asked for. If I return to Austin I will definitely stay here again!",
