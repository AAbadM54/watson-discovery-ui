  "text": "The Wagon House was perfect for our SXSW Interactive trip! The location was close enough to downtown that we could be there quickly via Uber or public bus. It was just far enough from the action that after a long day we could come home to relax and enjoy a margarita and great food from a close by restaurant. The SoFi (South First) neighborhood offers a unique flavor of Austin, is centrally located and safe! \r\n\r\nThe house itself was just the right size for 3 gals to have personal and social space. It was clean and comfortable, and we found all the amenities we needed in the kitchen, bathrooms and bedrooms. And the essentials, coffee and water, were there for us as well. \r\n\r\nLaura was so nice and easy to work with! Hope to be back next year! A great place to stay in Austin whether you are there for SXSW, ACL, or just to visit all the great things the city has to offer.",
