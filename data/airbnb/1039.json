  "text": "We had a great stay at Lis' house during our visit to Austin. The house is wonderful -- roomy, beautifully decorated, and clean. With lots of bedrooms and spaces for gathering, it was perfect for our group of family to stay together. The courtyard is especially great -- very peaceful. The location is also convenient to most of the major attractions in the city as well as food and nightlife. Lis was a fantastic host -- she welcomed us and made sure that we had everything that we needed. Her communication was excellent. We *highly* recommend this listing!",
