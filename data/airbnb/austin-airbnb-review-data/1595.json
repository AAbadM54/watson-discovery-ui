  "text": "First let me say that working with Dallas was awesome... The pre-arrival communication and follow-up was very responsive, helpful and pleasant.\r\n \r\nSix of us stayed for a long weekend in January, to attend a family wedding. The condo was exactly as advertised. It had all the amenities we needed. Very spacious, clean and inviting. Plenty of kitchen utensils, dishes, glasses.  A generous supply of sheets and towels. The d√©cor was tranquil and clean we felt at home immediately.  The bedrooms were clean and the beds were very comfortable. There is some very cool artwork on the walls. Sunday afternoon we had 13 people over to watch football there was plenty of room for everyone.  The patio was lovely.  \r\nLoved the convenience  of having a washer and dryer, plus the ease of convenient garage as well as street parking.\r\n \r\nWould definitely recommend this home!",
