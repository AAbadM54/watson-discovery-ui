  "text": "I came to Austin for the inaugural Formula 1 race at COTA in November 2012.  I rented the house from Thursday through Sunday and it could not have been better.  The location was wonderful as it was convenient to downtown, the racetrack, and the airport.  Upon arriving the house was immaculately clean and well sorted.  The owners provided free wifi and many other touches that you would expect at a hotel.  Further, they went above and beyond the call to ensure that we were comfortable.  The house has three bedrooms and 2.5 baths.  There was more than enough room for our three guests.  The owners were very easy to deal with and had excellent communication.",
