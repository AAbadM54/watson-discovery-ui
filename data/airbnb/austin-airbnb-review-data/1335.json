  "text": "The house was in a perfect location, close to UT and downtown. The room was huge, very clean and extremely comfortable. Benjamin and his roommates were very accommodating and great people. They immediately made me feel welcome and as if I were visiting old friends. I could not recommend this location enough and I wouldn't hesitate to book again.",
