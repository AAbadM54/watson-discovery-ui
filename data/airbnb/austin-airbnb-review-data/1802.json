  "text": "Staying at Barbara's house was a wonderful experience.  The house is very spacious, charming in style, and the pool was very refreshing.  The entire house was ready upon our arrival and had amenities like I would find in a hotel and more.  It was really easy to just show up and immediately feel like we've come home.  My daughter loved being in the pool during the Austin summer and playing with the outdoor cat.  \r\n\r\nIt is a great house and central location.  I look forward to staying there again.",
