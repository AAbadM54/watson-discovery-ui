  "text": "This place was awesome! Checking in was a breeze, as the hosts provided detailed check-in instructions in their initial confirmation. Everything was easy to access, including the common amenities in the house. I stayed in the airstream, welcomed with a cool blast of the AC and music on the radio :) I didn't actually end up seeing anyone during my stay, as I was in town for work and largely just in & out early and late. The space was really clean, which is something I'm usually pretty critical of (especially for an outdoor-ish space like this one). Bed was cozy, and the sink was nice to have in the Airstream so I could take care of essentials without having to go into the house. \r\n\r\nSmall bonus: there were little snacks out for me, which was a nice touch. Didn't take any, but loved that they were there in case of emergency. \r\n\r\nThe main areas were great, although I didn't utilize them much. Super cute retro living room, full kitchen, and a few games if you were up for lounging in the main areas. The backyard had great outdoor seating that I wish I had the time to enjoy!\r\n\r\nNeighborhood was quiet, and the Airstream was located in a gated backyard with a lot of trees surrounding the place. Couldn't have asked for a more private, cozy experience. Would definitely recommend and stay here again when I'm back in Austin!",
