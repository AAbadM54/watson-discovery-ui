  "text": "Shane made sure we had everything we needed. The condo was cool and comfortable for three couples.  The  Pool was just outside the door and Lady Bird Lake was just outside the complex where we had a dinner one night and rented Kayaks the next. The walkway that wraps around the lake is perfect for walking, jogging or riding as bike. Overall experience was wonderful.",
