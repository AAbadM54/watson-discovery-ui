  "text": "Trey was a wonderful host. He was able to accommodate a last minute booking at another location when our original request was taken. Was traveling with 4 other girls and they kept yapping about blowdryers, shampoos, conditioners, body washes etc. Etc. Trey quickly provided these amenities even though it was late at night. The location was perfect, very close to Congress and 10minute Uber from 6th street. To describe the house in one word- it's very... \"Austin\". If it were anywhere else some might call it odd but it being ATX and the vibrant culture, the house found its nook. Would definitely book with Trey again when we drop by town.",
