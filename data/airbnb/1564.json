  "text": "We stayed at this great place during our trip for the Austin Psych Festval. What an incredible place to relax and charge batteries for more music and more Austin experiences. Quiet neighborhood, easy to get in and out by car or bus to the city's heart (aprox. 15 min to downtown). Dallas, it's owner was truly helpful in advance and while there to answer any doubt or question we should have about his place or Austin. The townhouse was perfectly equiped (from kitchen to restrooms, from a big flat TV to a spacious parking, from air conditioning to a comfortable and big sofa) and it had a communal pool that we truly enjoyed under the classic austin heat. Me and the 6 friends that stayed there truly recommend it to anyone looking for a place to stay outside the city stress but close to its vivid action.",
