  "text": "Deborah greeted us at the door, helped us with our bags, and gave us great ideas for where to eat.  Another flight of stairs after riding the subway was daunting, but we already knew we should have taken a taxi.  The neighborhood was safe and had great restaurants.  Our room was generously stocked, spacious, clean, and attractive with beverages, fresh cut flowers, and lots of coffee.",
