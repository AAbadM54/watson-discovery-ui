  "text": "This property was very nice and well maintained and would recommend to small groups.  However, it is listed as a three bedroom three bath property when in reality what you get is two bedrooms and 2 1/2 baths.  It has an open loft with a mattress on the floor that gives no privacy.  We had three couples and two children for our vacation and had to find accommodations after arrival for one couple.  This was disappointing and we were faced with unexpected cost.",
