  "text": "What a wonderful place! It was perfect for our ACL weekend getaway.\r\n\r\nEmily's cottage is a quick walk through oak-lined Cherrywood to tons of awesome restaurants on Manor Rd, and a near-instant $8 Uber to and from downtown. The hammock on the back porch is a wonderful place to daydream and doze off after one too many margaritas.\r\n\r\nWe'll definitely stay here when we're back in town. Thanks!",
