  "text": "Tri was an amazing host. He went out of his way to make sure we had a comfortable stay, and as we are new to Austin, he showed us around some of his favourite areas which was awesome! His place is true to the photographs, and the bed is really comfortable. Would highly recommend and plan to stay with him again!",
