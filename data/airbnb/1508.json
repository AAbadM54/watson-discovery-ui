  "text": "What a beautiful house! I stayed here for my 30th birthday party/engagement party/reunion with my college friends. The home has such charm and character, and everyone really loves the personal touches throughout the place - not your cookie cutter house, for sure! Plus the amount of space was perfect for 10 people - it could fit even more and still be comfortable. The outdoor space looks like so much fun, I only wish we had planned more time at the house to enjoy it! The neighborhood is peaceful, and close to the freeway which made it really easy to get to downtown Austin as well as New Braunfels further South, where we went for tubing down the river. Melissa gave us clear instructions/information and the place was immaculately clean when we arrived. There's also basically everything we need available to use - even travel size toiletries like a hotel. :) She's super easy going and responsive. I couldn't have asked for a better experience and will definitely be returning!",
