  "text": "We had a great stay in this little house. The hosts were very communicative and accessible, and gave clear instructions about how to get in and settled. Good location, and the neighborhood was quiet on a Saturday night, which we appreciated. Do note that this is a pet-friendly listing; we had some allergy issues when we decided to sit on the living room rug because it seems to trap pet hair but once we figured that out and switched to sitting on the actual furniture we were fine.",
