  "text": "Truly lovely property. Main house is very cozy and inviting. Our large group had no trouble being comfortable during our stay. \nThe back yard was spectacular. Plenty of space for parking and we enjoyed the games provided. Wish I was a cooler month so we would enjoy the evenings by the fireplace. \n\nOur over all experiance was excellent and we would love to stay here again maybe during the cooler months.",
