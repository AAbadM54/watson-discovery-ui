  "text": "I had no idea where this would be since I was visiting Austin for the first time. To say this is centrally located would be an understatement. Do you want to go have Vegan ice cream, it’s 5 minutes away. Do you want to go see the original Whole Foods, it’s 15 minutes away. Downtown, the donut place that serves the Fat Elvis, the best nail salon….all 10 to 15 minutes away \r\nCheck in was beyond easy, received a very detailed email the day before that provided wifi, etc. They have cable. The house was very cute and clean (I think they may use a service). I’m a bit OCD so if I say it was clean it was spotless. There is a washer dryer. I would definitely stay here again.",
