  "text": "Claire was a GREAT host. The apartment was super clean and had absolutely everything  you needed. The neighborhood was amazing and hall was close to everything you need. The train was about a 4 min walk away and took you directly to Manhattan about a 25 min ride. The neighborhood was super quiet! I will totally come back again. This was my first air b&b experience and Claire made it great!",
