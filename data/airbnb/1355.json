  "text": "Ben is seriously the nicest guy. After a week of not being able to book anything on AirBnB, I found Ben the day of my trip. He not only responded to my request quickly, but was kind enough to let me stay at his place on incredibly short notice. Beyond that he was always available for recommendations and instructions on getting around the city. And that's just Ben. The accommodation itself quickly felt like home, food was always available and privacy was never a problem. I really truly appreciated the experience, and my gratitude goes out to Ben. Thanks.",
