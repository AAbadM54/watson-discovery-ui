  "text": "We had a great time staying here. It was just as advertised: clean, great neighborhood and close to the subway. We were a bit worried by the big snow storm the previous weekend, but all was in order at the building. \r\n\r\nWe would definitely stay here again. We've rented several AirBnB apartments in Brooklyn and this one was by far the best.",
