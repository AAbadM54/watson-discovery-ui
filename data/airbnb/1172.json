  "text": "This Airstream was even better than it looked in the pictures, and the pictures look pretty damn good! It's super-clean, the mattress is very comfortable, the overall interior design is delightful. There are so many thoughtful, functional touches. I recommend it highly. \r\n\r\nThe neighborhood is residential, cute and quiet, yet the location is close to all things in groovy South Austin. Loved it! The common area in the house is really lovely and user-friendly.; t's spare, spotless and thoroughly pimped out with designy vintage furniture and oddments. The kitchen and bathroom are great, the bed linens and towels are really nice.  Small touches abound. \r\n\r\nThis is Airbnb at its best. Rene is generous, flexible, responsive and thoroughly accommodating. She's a 5-star gal.",
