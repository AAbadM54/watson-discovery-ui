  "text": "Sue could not have been a better host if she tried!! From the moment we landed in Austin Sue assisted us with lifts from the airport, gave us a little tour of Austin and pointed out some good restaurants and bars that we never would have noticed unless a local told us. \nShe provided us with so much helpful information about things to do during our stay and the best ways to travel around etc.\nThe condo was in a perfect spot - in walking distance to everything. The air conditioning in the condo was fantastic, especially after a long day in the heat, it was all we wanted.\nThe apartment was very clean and was very well equipped with things from shampoo, to a full set of bath and beach towels to some complimentary and wine. \nThere is a double bed and a fold out sofa which was a bit squishy for 4 of us but 1 of us just slept on the lounge instead of 2 on the sofa which did us just fine. \nI could not recommend this place enough!!",
