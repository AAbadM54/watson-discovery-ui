  "text": "Staying with Mike and Robin was an absolute pleasure from start to finish. We had so much fun hanging out with them, and it really felt like we were staying with good friends. They were so kind and generous with their time, and really helped us on our way at the beginning of an epic trip. We genuinely hope we will see them again either in Austin or the UK.\n\nThe house is gorgeous, with a lovely open plan kitchen with everything you could need. The garden is huge and a nice place to relax with a cold beer. The bedroom is cosy but more than adequate, and the private bathroom is lovely and big. Being able to do laundry was a life saver. Everything is spotlessly clean. \n\nThe neighbourhood is peaceful and pretty, and just a couple of blocks away from the fabulous bars and restaurants on 1st ave and south congress.\n\nA great place to stay!",
