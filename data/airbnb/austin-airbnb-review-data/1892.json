  "text": "What a great place! Brett, our host, was friendly, responsive, and helpful. He kindly let us stash our stuff at the condo before the check-in time. What's more, the place was clean, up-to-date and attractive, and the location was safe and convenient. But the best part, undoubtedly, is the balcony. We spent more time there than inside the apartment! If you're visiting Austin, I definitely recommend this place.",
