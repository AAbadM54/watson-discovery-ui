  "text": "In short: Anne was an amazing host. She and her partner were super friendly, and made me feel comfortable in a new place; it honestly felt more like I was staying with a friend than with a \"host.\" \r\n\r\nShe was also very accommodating: she pulled out an air mattress because so I wouldn't have to sleep on the couch (even though that's what I booked), and offered to drive me to ACC for SXSW when our schedules aligned.\r\n\r\nThe house itself was clean, without being stuffy. All around, just a great experience. I highly recommend Anne for anyone looking to stay in Austin for a few days.",
