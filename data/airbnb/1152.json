  "text": "We had a wonderful time in Austin and a very nice part of it had to do with our accommodations and our host, Sue. Sue offered to pick us up from the airport and also to provide any groceries we might need. There was coffee, snacks, beer and water waiting for us. Sue greeted us upon our arrival and was readily available to help when we had questions. The king size bed was very comfortable. The location is fabulous and the security for the building is more than adequate. We would stay here again if we return to Austin. Thanks Sue.",
