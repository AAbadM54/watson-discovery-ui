  "text": "Wonderful weekend in Austin with girlfriends, in the perfect setting at Casa SoCo!  Ashley was very extremely responsive and helpful as we planned our stay, and brought our bride-to-be a lovely bottle of wine when we arrived at the house.  Great location with shops and restaurants just a short 10-15 minute walk, though our group spent as much time hanging out at the house enjoying the space-- perfect for a group of friends! I've already recommended the house to a few friends and I'd definitely stay here again when I return to Austin.",
