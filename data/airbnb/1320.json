  "text": "Marisa and Clayton are excellent hosts! They are so nice that they even let me use their bikes. If you stay with them you will feel very welcome.\r\n\r\nThe room is spacious and very comfy. The kitchen and the living room are big too. The house also have a backyard that you can use if you want to stay outside. At the beginning I was a bit worried about the safety of the neighborhood, but in the end I found it to be pretty safe -- no complaints at all. I highly recommend you to stay with them.",
