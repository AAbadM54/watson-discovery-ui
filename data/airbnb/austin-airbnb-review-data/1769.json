  "text": "Ashley was just wonderful, she made us feel like we already knew her before even arriving. She always kept in touch to ensure we had our travel plans sorted, and asked if she could be of any help before we arrived, even asked if we had any specific coffee requests. During our stay she was great at ensuring we had everything we needed. The home was just gorgeous, we all LOVED staying there...better than any hotel. I would actually say the home is better than in the photos. If you are heading to Austin...this is a place you should look at staying in. Great space, Lots of awesome resources in the home about Austin...even boardgames, and great reads for rainy days. Very Clean, Beautiful area, easy to walk to all the awesome streets...just the perfect house to be in.",
