  "text": "Erica and her team made us feel very welcome.  Everything was as advertised.  This is a fantastic rental close to downtown, MoPac, and the UT campus.  The fenced yard was perfect for our small dog.  The water pressure was good in the showers, the beds were clean and comfortable, the Wi-Fi signal was strong, the televisions were enormous with hundreds of channels, and the kitchen was compact but very functional.  All in, we had a great stay and hope to come back!",
