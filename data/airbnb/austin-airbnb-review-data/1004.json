  "text": "House was charming and wonderful and quite spacious; loved the dining room with it's built-in granite top work space that also functions as a coffee bar. The whole place was extremely comfortable. The neighborhood was fantastic- beautiful with great dining spots and close to hot spots and shopping. But as fantastic as all this was, the hosts were what made the stay special. They were patient and helpful with my husband's serious handicaps; they were interesting and fun to talk to - full of energy and humor, but never intrusive and always careful to give us plenty of space. Whole stay was fantastic. If I could give 10 stars, I would.",
