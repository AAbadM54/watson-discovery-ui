  "text": "Tri was very welcoming and accommodating to our early arrival time. We were able to check in a little earlier than his normal wake up time and it was very convenient for us. It was comfortable and easy to get around where his place is located, so it made our first Austin trip an awesome one! I definitely recommend him for any future stay. Thank you Tri!",
