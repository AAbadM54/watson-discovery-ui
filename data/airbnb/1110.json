  "text": "My boyfriend and I are driving cross country and wanted to stop in Austin. We were looking for a nice place close to a great pArt of town and we found it! Mike and Robin responded very quickly to our request and we checked in at 3:30pm. Robin and Mike were very friendly and helpful and gave us a lot of feedback on what to do in Austin! We drove to south congress which was a few minute drive down the street (could have walked but we were scared of the storm approaching). There are several bars and restaurants close by! We had our own room and bathroom and the bed was super comfy! We also had some freshly brewed coffee the next morning :) we would definitely stay here again!",
