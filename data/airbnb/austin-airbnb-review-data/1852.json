  "text": "Blaine's home was in a great location and the bed was super comfortable. My boyfriend and I are currently road tripping across the country with all of our belongings in our car so it was super nice to have on-site parking. We only crossed paths with Blaine once but he was extremely kind and generous with suggestions of what to do in the surrounding area (and also gave us advice on our next destination; Santa Fe).",
