  "text": "Rob was very accommodating and provided suggestions on local restaurants and bars which were great suggestions. In regards to the apartment it was a bit tight but it is expected in these nyc places. Stairs were very unexpected and the lobby had a very bad odor of urine. The apartment could have used more cleaning but it was doable for our short stay.",
