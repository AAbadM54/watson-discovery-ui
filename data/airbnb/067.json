  "text": "Amazing!!! This was my first AirBNB experience. I could not have scripted it any better. Susannah was very helpful and that took away all the stress that may come with planning and trip. The location is an amazing one as well! The view of NY city, the water, the big bridge are incredible.  The decor and feel of the space was also really nice.  You get a sense of the history while enjoying every modern convenience.  If you just want to get away, or enjoy the city while getting to know another borough I think this is the best spot!",
