  "text": "The townhouse was perfect for our Half-Ironman trip. Location was super convenient to the airport which was great since many of us came in at different times, and left at different times. Very close to South Congress, and an easy drive to Downtown Austin! The case of Lonestar upon our arrival was definitely a nice surprise as well!",
