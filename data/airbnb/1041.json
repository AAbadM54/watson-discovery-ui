  "text": "The house was great. Lis was also very helpful and nice to communicate with. It's about 15mins drive to the main SXSW area and since it was easy to get cars (Uber and Lyft) this year, getting around was easy from and to the house. The backyard was great for the nice weather we had. Big kitchen and having 3 bathrooms were nice! Definitely would recommend this place.",
