  "text": "Ashley's Casa SoCo was the PERFECT home for our bachelorette weekend in Austin. Ashley was in touch prior to our trip with house instructions and cool Austin suggestions and was easy to reach with any questions. The house and neighborhood had a great vibe, and we were able to walk to a lot of cool shops and eats. I wholeheartedly recommend Ashley's house for any group of ladies visiting Austin!",
