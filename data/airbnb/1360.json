  "text": "Ben was a wonderful host! His place is cozy and perfect for an extended stay. His house is conveniently located next to the metro rail for easy access to downtown. The room was very clean, quiet, and comfortable. I would definitely book again and recommend his place to my friends and family. \nP.S. If you're really nice he might even throw in a free cooking lesson.",
