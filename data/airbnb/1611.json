  "text": "We found the condo very spacious as described.  We were meeting my son, daughter-in-law, and 10 month old in Austin for a family vacation.  The layout of the condo was perfect for us.\r\nRealizing we would need a full size crib and high chair,  I was  able to rent on line and have them delivered from Ashlie at I Love Baby.  \r\nThe proximity was a plus for our needs.  The condo had good wifi and we were able to video stream movies on that nice big TV in the living room.  Dallas was very responsive before and during our stay. Would definitely consider staying there again.",
