  "text": "We absolutely loved Dallas's place!  He was super responsive in answering our questions. We stayed for just about a week. We were visiting for QuiltCon which was taking place in the Austin Convention Center.  The proximity was excellent for downtown (a 10 minute drive) and the south congress area (a 5 minute drive).  Each of us in our party of 7 was able to comfortably sleep, bathe and eat.  There was enough room for all of us without being too crowded.  Thanks for such a great experience!",
