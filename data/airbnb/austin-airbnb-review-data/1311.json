  "text": "In short, a fantastic play to stay with a fantastic host.\r\n\r\nJulie is very friendly and went out of her way to make our stay a wonderful experience. She took into account what brought us to Austin in setting up the apartment for us and making suggestions from her detailed guidebook that might suit us. As some of the other reviews say, the bed is supremely comfortable; the place is as advertised and possibly even more lovely in person. It's obvious that Julie really enjoys hosting visitors in The Cloud Palace and does a good job of it. When we arrived, she showed us around the apartment, and then sat around and chatted with us for a bit.\r\n\r\nThe surrounding neighborhood is a lovely historic area with access to a number of restaurants and amenities, which Julie also took care to point out to us.",
