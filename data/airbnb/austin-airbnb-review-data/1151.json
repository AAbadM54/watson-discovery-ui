  "text": "Our stay at Sue's place was exceptional.  We arrived a day early for ACL music festival on weekend 2.  She gave a brief tour of the place and the run down of all the basics (key codes, entrance/exits, neighborhood spots, etc.).  It was a great location (6th street is popular) if you want to be in the heart of downtown action (noise was never an issue).  We felt safe & secure the whole time.  We walked mostly but Uber, pedicab (bicycle cabs), metro bus, and taxi are all available.  We walked to the shuttle bus area downtown for ACL each day.  We had a food truck that was great, a liquor store for spirits, and a grocery store that were all across the street so no worries about those kinds of things.  She was one of the best Airbnb hosts I've encountered so far.  From the pride she took in the cleanliness of the place, the updates on fun things to do around town, and also just the vault of information for Austin,  I would highly recommend her for you or anyone you know planning a trip to Austin, TX.  Hope to stay here again one day.  Cheers.",
