  "text": "I honestly can't say enough things about how great it was staying at Joe's. His place is incredibly beautiful, and the coolest modern home I've ever stayed in. All of us were blown away by his decorating, and we spent the entire weekend talking about how we would LOVE to live in his house. From the working jukebox to rooftop patio, the place was beautiful, comfortable, and simply one of the best -- if not the best -- experiences I've ever had while traveling.\r\n\r\nJoe was also a great host. Scheduling with him was super easy, and he was very responsive and available. He stayed in touch with us via text throughout the weekend to make sure everything was going well, and made coming and going as easy as walking up to our own place when we got home from vacation. The location was great too -- a short walk away from a brand new beer garden/brewery, and a 15 minute bus ride from downtown (for $1, and the bus stop is a couple hundred feet from his front door) or a 15 minute cab ride if you don't want to take public transportation.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I can't recommend staying with Joe enough -- everything about the stay was great, and Joe was a perfect host. Thanks Joe, I will definitely be in touch if we ever stay in Austin again!",
