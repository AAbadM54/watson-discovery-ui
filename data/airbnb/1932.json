  "text": "Brett's place couldn't be nicer and is absolutely ideal for couples. Its location is perfect as it's in a quiet neighborhood that's in crawling distance from downtown. Brett is an awesome host who genuinely cares if his guests enjoy themselves. Moreover, he's just a downright nice guy to boot. This was without a doubt one of my better Airbnb experiences. Cheers, Brett!",
