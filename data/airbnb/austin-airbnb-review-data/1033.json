  "text": "We were a group of 4 couples and the hose was just right! Lots of space, great beds in every room, large and comfy living room and a great deck in the yard. The location can't be beat (so close to SoCo) and the photos don't do the house justice. To top it off, booking in with Adam was easy and he was responsive to queries.",
