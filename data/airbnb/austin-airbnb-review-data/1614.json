  "text": "Dallas's place was at a great price and was conveniently located near the airport. Cab ride downtown was only ~$12-16. We had a group of 7 and were able to comfortably fit between the 2 king beds, 1 double, and a comfy couch. Dallas was extremely helpful in giving is ideas on things to do while in town. He also was quite flexible with his schedule, allowing us a pretty early check in. If I was back in Austin is definitely consider staying here again. Thanks!",
