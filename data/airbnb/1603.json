  "text": "Dallas was a great host during our stay in Austin at his place. The apt itself was very clean and had amazing king sized beds (which I love!) and the couch was super comfy. He was very responsive with any inquiries we had during the stay and checked in via email every now and then to make sure we were happy. I'd definitely recommend staying here - easy to get to, close to downtown, clean, etc. Thanks Dallas!",
