  "text": "We had a wonderful time at Casa SoCo. Ash was a great host. She made sure that we had everything we needed. The house was even better than advertised. It was extremely comfortable and the neighborhood was perfect -- nice and quiet but close to lots of entertainment, food, etc. I highly recommend Casa SoCo to anyone who's looking for a place to stay in Austin.",
