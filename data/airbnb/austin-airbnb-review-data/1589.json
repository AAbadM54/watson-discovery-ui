  "text": "Dallas house was great!. We rented his condo on the ACL weekend , we were only a bus ride away from downtown (there is a bus stop super close to the house) or we could take a 10 minute cab ride, either way was good. \r\nWe were a group of 8 people and we were all able to sleep comfortably (2 slept either on the sofa or in the extra mattress provided by Dallas), so the house is very spacious and also I liked the decoration.(Dallas I loved your Modest Mouse poster!!)\r\n\r\nDallas was very helpful with every thing, quickly response and very communicative, he was a very good host and without a doubt his house is an excellent place to stay, I would totally recommend staying here.\r\n\r\nThanks your letting us stay here we had a great time!",
