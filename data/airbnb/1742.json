  "text": "Anna was a great hostess for the weekend.  She was very communicative with before, during and after our visit.  She additionally was very sensitive to our travel needs and went above and beyond to ensure that we had a relaxing visit to Austin.\r\nThe house was perfect for us - the location was quiet, the neighbors were nice, the space was clean and had everything we needed.\r\nAs always we enjoyed our visit to Austin - but especially with this accommodation.  Thank you.",
