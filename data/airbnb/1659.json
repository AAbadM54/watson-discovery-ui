  "text": "What an awesome house!  The Sparrow house is beautiful and has obviously been cared for and furnished with a lot of thought and love..  We had 8 people stay here, and with 3 bedrooms and 1 bath it was a lot, but Ayn leant us an air mattress and we are all comfortable enough.  We had big plans to explore Austin (and we did) but we ended up spending a TON of time in the back yard because it was so so nice.  Ayn made it super easy to get into the house and left specific instructions on what we needed to do to check out.   The house is super accessable to downtown and is a 2 minute walk from the brewery ABGB. Overall an awesome experience.",
