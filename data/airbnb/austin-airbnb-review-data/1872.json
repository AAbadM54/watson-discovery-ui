  "text": "Great experience. It was my first staying in a shared home on AirBnB and it was a great intro. Blaine was warm and welcoming, and his home was absolutely gorgeous. I came in and crashed as I was exhausted so I didn't get to spend much time in the place but I would definitely recommend it to someone traveling to austin and looking for a clean place to sleep :)",
