  "text": "I enjoyed my stay at Chalu's place. Although she wasn't there during my stay she responded in a timely manner. Her place was cozy, clean, and comfortable. Chalu was available via text and left information for our stay. Great location which was not to far from downtown. This was my first experience with AirBnB and it most certainly won't be my last.",
