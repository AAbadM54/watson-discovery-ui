  "text": "I'd stay here again. My room had the benefit of being a corner room by the windows and fire escape but the noise from the street made it difficult to sleep (even with Mac's earplugs).  \r\n\r\nThe staff were super nice. The bathrooms clean & I loved the rainfall shower heads. The place has a very pleasant vibe. Cool neighborhood & close to MTA. I ate breakfast at Feemans across the street & loved that too.",
