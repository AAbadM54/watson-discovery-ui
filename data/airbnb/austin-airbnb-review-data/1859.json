  "text": "Blaine was very warm and welcoming when I arrived.  The room listing was exactly as described on the listing and within about 10 minutes' drive of downtown. It was exactly what I needed, with some nice extras like the 'hidden chocolates' - see if you can find them :)\r\n\r\nGot some advice from Blaine about what to check out on (college football)game day and to get there early!\r\n\r\nI also got a great tip for breakfast the following day from Blaine's housemate - Veracruz, excellent breakfast burritos!\r\n\r\nThanks Blaine (and housemate) - I would stay again if I ever visited Austin!",
