  "text": "My experience with Patrick was great, he had great recommendations for local places to eat and was very easy to communicate with leading up to the stay. The accommodations however were less than satisfactory. This is definitely a bachelor pad, which is fine but it could have used a good cleaning prior to us arriving. The bed isn't very comfortable (just a heads up up for anyone with a bad back). The location was GREAT for ACL (we were able to walk to the festival- about a 25-30 minute walk), but like most places the price was raised substantially for the ACL weekend.",
