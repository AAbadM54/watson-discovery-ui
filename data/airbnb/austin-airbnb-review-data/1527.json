  "text": "Missy did a great job of communicating with me when I was considering the place, before we arrived, and during our stay. We felt welcome and well oriented. The house was just perfect for my bridal shower. Plenty of parking, and easy to find, spacious, only about 15 minutes from downtown. We had all we need in the kitchen to prepare and serve all of our 25 guests.  I can not say enough about  the cute decor inside and out- the pictures on the site don't do it justice.",
