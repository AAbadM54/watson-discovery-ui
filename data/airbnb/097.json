  "text": "Mike was a fantastic Airbnb host.   Although we never met him in person he communicated very quickly, provided help and advice when  asked and was very accommodating on our request for late check out.   The apartment was just as the photos - very spacious for 3 adults, comfortable beds, clean and in a great location close to everything.",
