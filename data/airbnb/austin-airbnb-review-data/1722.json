  "text": "Anna was a wonderful host. My wife and I were looking for a place to stay at the last minute, and Anna was very gracious to work with us. The house is cozy and pristine with all the amenities you could ask for. The house is located in a pleasant neighborhood in the North Loop with wonderful local restaurants and coffee shops with in a short distance.  We would definitely stay here again when our travels take us back to Austin.",
