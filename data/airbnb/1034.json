  "text": "The home is in a wonderful walkable area where we checked off some of the must do’s in South Congress.  The home has 4 real beds (full or larger) which were prefect for our girls getaway weekend. The home is updated with an open floor plan and has also preserved the natural charm of a cottage.  The beds were comfortable and the bathrooms were bright. The home is clean, well stocked with plenty of white towels, spacious, and well decorated. We loved the L-shaped couch which allowed us to gather and enjoy the living space while listing to music.  There is a washer and dryer which would be great for families or for travelers who want to pack light. There are plenty of speakers by the TV to add to the music ambiance as we relaxed in the home and wifi was fast and strong enough for all of us to stream our music. \r\n\r\nNeighborhood walkable highlights: Tom’s shoes & coffee, Kendra Scott flagship store, Jo’s (Iced Turbo coffee), Snack bar, Continental Club, Amy's, healthy grocery story, Guero’s Taco bar, and Magnolia’s 24 hour diner.  We ubered everywhere from here within a very reasonable fare exploring ATX since we did not rent a car.  \r\n\r\nWe met the husband and wife host who were very friendly and took the time to set up the Pandora music from the Blue-Ray.  We felt safe in the community and loved the Austin charm of the home.   In addition, it was great to stay with an experienced host and would highly recommend this home to any families or large groups.  \r\n\r\nThank you for allowing us to be guests in your home, we hope to visit your wonderful city again and hope your calendar is open.",
