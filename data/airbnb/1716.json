  "text": "Anna's Bungalow was perfect for our stay!  The house was tastefully decorated and very comfortable.  We enjoyed spending time in the backyard as it's really large.  Anna was quick to respond to any questions and was the prefect host.  We will definitely stay here the next time we're in Austin.",
