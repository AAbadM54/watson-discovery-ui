  "text": "Julie and David are very nice people! It was nice to see some baby staff on the counter and some food and drinks in refrigerator when we arrived. You feel like someone is really waiting for you and it feels like you are coming home. Everything was as on the pictures. In my opinion even better. Terrace and backyard is way bigger then on the picture, and they put kids table with chairs there for our older daughter. We spent a lot of good time on the terrace, because the weather was perfect for that. The bedrooms are big enough. And king size bed is very comfy. It was easy to reach Julie by phone or email always. And she did maximum to make us feel like at home. We had an amazing time at this place! Thank you guys!!!",
