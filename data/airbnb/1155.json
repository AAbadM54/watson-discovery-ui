  "text": "We could not have had a more perfect first experience with Airbnb! First off, from our very first communication, Sue treated us like family, even offering to pick us up from the airport! I actually ended up having my flight delayed and delayed and ultimately cancelled. Sue was helpful the entire way through the craziness even offering to be available by phone when I thought I would have to drive to Austin late at night from Houston! Luckily, found a flight and didn't have to, however, Sue's kindness and help was above and beyond during a very stressful travel day!\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at Sue's condo all the stress was forgotten! The place could not have been more perfect! From soft bathrobes to delicious local beer and coffee in the fridge Sue thought of every detail! And the (email hidden)RFECTION!!!! We were there on Halloween and I have to say there is NOTHING quite like 6th Street in Austin on Halloween and our chic Airbnb was right there! Btw, fantastic taco truck right across the street and walking distance to every restaurant, bar, or music venue you could possibly want to go to!\r\n\r\nWe were there for the Austin Film Festival and the world premier of our documentary Of Dogs and Men and Sue even made it to a screening of our film which meant so much to us! \r\n\r\nWe cannot recommend Sue and her hospitality more! Thank you thank you thank you Sue!!!! We will be back for sure!\r\n\r\nOz and Pj",
