  "text": "Spacious Townhouse Great Proximity indeed! For substantially less than what it would have cost to bunk seven people in a roach motel during F1 weekend, we got to stay in a place that had all of the comforts of home (including beer, snacks, and a washer and dryer).\r\n\r\nIt's close to downtown (a 10 minute drive) and the airport (a 15 minute drive). Plenty of space for seven people to spread out their things, lounge, and sleep. The beds were reasonably comfortable, linens and towels were nice and plushy, the bathrooms and kitchen were clean. Thanks Dallas!",
