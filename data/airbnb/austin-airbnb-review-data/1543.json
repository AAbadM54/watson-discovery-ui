  "text": "Chalu was nothing short of amazing!!! I booked my reservation with her at the last minute and she graciously accepted my offer. Communication was very swift, and informative,everything was clearly laid out concerning the setup and access to the house. Chalu really made me feel like family, always available to provide suggestions of things to do, accompanied me to dinner on my first night and kept in contact with me during the duration of my stay. The home and room are clean and within 10-20 minutes driving distance from popular hangouts and the airport. THANK YOU Chalu for a wonderful stay in Austin!",
