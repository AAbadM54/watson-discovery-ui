She was very welcoming and attentive to settle me in, and showed me all the best places around and where to find a supermarket, which is really close by the way.\r\n\r\nThe house is in a great neighborhood, Dumbo, and 3 minute walking to the F line subway, which will take you to the centre of Manhattan in 15 minutes. \r\n\r\nThe house is very clean and it has a great living room and kitchen with everything you need to cook, and a clean and spacious bathroom. \r\n\r\nThank you Nesli for everything and I will be staying a lot more time :)",
