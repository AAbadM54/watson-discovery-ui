  "text": "We were visiting Austin for my mother-in-law's birthday and Ashley left a wonderful welcome note on the board along with a bottle of wine to begin our celebration! The house was perfect for our group of 6 (including two young boys) and the location was walking distance to S Congress, where we were able to walk to breakfast, grab coffee or hit our five year old's favorite place on earth \"Big Top Candy Shop.\"  The decor really represented Austin at its finest.. modern, eclectic, comfortable.  And S Congress is packed with many incredible shops, restaurants, bars, and live music. \r\n\r\nIt was a terrific weekend, and a great house! Ashley went out of her way to ensure we were comfortable, happy, and equipped to make the most of the neighborhood!",
