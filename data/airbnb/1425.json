  "text": "I had a great time staying with Alyson!  The house is just beautiful, and Alyson was so, so helpful and nice.  She even saved me food from her potlucks which I took to lunch (I was in town for a conference) - lucky me!  The airbed was a really quality one - I slept great.  I would totally come back!  Oh yeah, and the cat (dear prudence!) is adorable - I wanted to steal her!",
