  "text": "The home is tucked away among greenery and a charming neighborhood near Barton Springs.  She has created an inviting an organic living space for her guests. The view from my room was of natural ivy, trees and plenty of natural, diffused light. \r\n\r\nAlyson was great at communicating. She introduced herself days before my arrival and took care to be available if I needed anything. Instructions and tips were provided and thorough.\r\n\r\nNot only is she a spectacular house host, but a host for Austin as well. She offered knowledge of local yoga, meditation, healing and dance classes. She also shared recommended restaurants and hangouts to try out. \r\n\r\n(I hope Lotus House is available next time I come visit!) :)",
