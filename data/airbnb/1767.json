  "text": "Ashley was very responsive and helped us prepare for our first Girl's Weekend in Austin, including her personalized recommendations and added welcome amenities.  The location was ideal...close walk/bike/drive to all the hot spots.   Loved the decor!  The house was comfortable and ideal for the 5 of us.  Would stay again!",
