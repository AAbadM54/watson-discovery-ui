  "text": "Blaine was a great communicator and even though we didn't have a chance to meet in person I had a pleasant stay at his place. \r\n\r\nHis roommate was lovely, as well as his dog! \r\n\r\nThe location was about a 20 minute bus ride from downtown but very easy to get to (as are most places in Austin!)\r\n\r\nI recommend this room to anyone looking for a sweet deal. The bed is very comfortable, and the house is very inviting. I can only imagine how lovely the backyard would be should it not be overcast and rainy :)\r\n\r\nThanks Blaine!",
