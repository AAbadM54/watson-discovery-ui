  "text": "Dallas' place is nestled in a nice condo complex just east of I-35. With a 2 car garage that steps down into a mini courtyard (for late night contemplation under the stars above). The main floor has a kitchen, dining room, open living room with vaulted ceiling, half bath and a master bedroom with a full bath. Upstairs is loft area with window, another 3/4 bath and a big bedroom. A big HEB is only 5 minutes away on the bus (stops directly out front). We took the bus out and about to South Congress, Lamar, the Warehouse District and 6th street, then usually took a cab home. We swam in the pool daily to relax after nights of live music and great food. This place is a clean, affordable condo that lets you slip out of the noise of busy streets but still be just 10-15 minutes away from everything.",
