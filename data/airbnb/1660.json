  "text": "Ayn was a fantastic host. She's a great communicator--quick to respond and sweet to boot!\r\n\r\nThe house is exactly as it seems on the website. Each bedroom is more beautiful than the next and the neighborhood is close to some fantastic areasâ€¦you truly feel like you're in the middle of everything.\r\n\r\nWe found the house spotless and we aimed to leave it that way. Ayn left a lot of material for us to find our way around and to get some great food/great experiences. And we did! \r\n\r\nI would recommend the Sparrow House to anyone. Great experience.",
