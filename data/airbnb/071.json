  "text": "I stayed about a month here and everything went smoothly. \r\n\r\nEven though I never met JB in person, he was a kind host and has always replied very quickly to my emails and arranged everything perfectly for my stay. \r\n\r\nI also appreciate that he is very honest about the apartment, not trying to oversell it, so you know what to expect. Thanks for that!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's true that the room is overlooking a busy street but the noise didn't bother me at all (I'm from Paris and big cities are noisy).\r\n\r\nI was concerned about the cleanliness but the bedroom was actually clean, with clean bed linens and towels waiting for me. Although let's be honest, the bathroom was filthy. I cleaned it on my arrival but it doesn't remain clean for a long time, which is the only inconvenience I had.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 3 roommates are friendly and very respectful of your privacy, no problem whatsoever. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood is cool, I felt safe and the apartment is located about 2 blocks from the subway (I work in Manhattan and the commute was pretty easy). Lots of shops & restaurants nearby.",
