  "text": "This was our first stay in an Airbnb where we didn't have the entire place, just a room in someone's house. Austin was having F1 races and we were lucky to get this place. We were nervous about that but our hosts were awesome! They were helpful and friendly and made us feel very welcome. The room was very comfy, with a bath down the hall for us to use. The location couldn't have been more perfect. We went out every night and was close to everything. We would stay again for sure. Thanks to Mike and Robin, we had one of the BEST trips ever! (Also, their sweet cat Ji-Ji was icing on the cake)",
