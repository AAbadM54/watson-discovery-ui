  "text": "My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Andrew's charming apartment.  Though she doesn't like stairs, she didn't mind climbing one flight to this place, which was spotlessly clean, which included a little office off the bedroom (where I could do some business on my laptop), and which was furnished with everything we needed--including all the makings for a full breakfast each morning.  Andrew welcomed us graciously, helped us with our suitcase, and came at once when I asked him about working the TV set.  (It helps that he lives downstairs in the same building.)  Altogether, this is easily one of the best places we've rented through AirBnB.",
