  "text": "First of all of like to start by saying THANK YOU JORDAN! \r\n\r\nMy girlfriend and I planned a weak long trip to New York and we spent months taking care of our itinerary and plan. I came across Jordan's listing and I contacted him with some questions about the area, the listing, and some tips and tricks. Although he was currently away from his listing, several time zones away, he was extremely organized and accommodating. He answered all our questions and gave us some great suggestions.\r\n\r\nThe best place about the listing was the convenience of location. It was in a nice neighborhood with amazing restaurants within walking distance! The subways are right down the street and easy to use, didn't get lost once!\r\n\r\nJordan included a very comprehensive manual that detailed all information needed about the listing. Its true to the pictures, well kept, and very clean. \r\n\r\nThank you Jordan for providing us with a home away from home.",
