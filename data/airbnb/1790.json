  "text": "It was located in a great area.  We loved walking and hanging out on South Congress.  The pictures of the house listed on Airbnb were very accurate.  The place was clean and had all we needed.  It fit the 6 adults very comfortably.  Ashley was great!  She checked in a few times to see how things were going and if we needed anything.  Would definitely stay here if ever in Austin again!",
