  "text": "Alyson was very respectful of our privacy and always prompt to respond to our questions via text. The neighborhood is quiet and the house is a perfect location for your ACL weekend. If you plan on exploring all the different areas Austin has to offer (6th Street, Rainey, East Austin etc.) I would suggest a rental car for this location. We did not have a rental car for most of our trip and we ended up spending a lot of time and money (busses and Ubers) getting to and from the Lotus House.",
