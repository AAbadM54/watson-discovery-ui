  "text": "Jinny was a very kind and hospitable host! She went out of her way to ensure we had the best experience in Austin from texting us her favorite restaurants in the area, to inviting us out dancing. We also loved the home's location and how clean and comfortable our room was. The neighborhood is very safe and just a short drive from downtown. Would definitely stay here again if I find myself in Austin again!",
