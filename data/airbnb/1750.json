  "text": "Ashley hosted my family and I at Casa Soco for my wedding in November, and we had such a positive experience! The house is spacious, comfortable, and conveniently located, with just the right touch of that quirky Austin feel. Very true to its description. Communication throughout the process was very smooth, and Ashley was extremely responsive and proactive in ensuring that everything was just right for us. She really went above and beyond in making us feel welcome, and I would highly highly recommend choosing Casa Soco for your stay in Austin - we're very glad that we did.",
