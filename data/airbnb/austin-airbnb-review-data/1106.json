  "text": "What a beautiful home! Inside such an interesting neighborhood.  Nice smelling cooking as soon as we got there, amazing coffee in the morning.  We had a pretty late night out on the town and they were perfectly okay with us coming in late. It was only for one night but I would definitely come stay here again.  Also the huge wind-chimes hanging from the front porch sound beautiful.",
