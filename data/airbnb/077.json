  "text": "Michelle is great! She is very kind and helpful, and she will send you a very detailed manual before you arrive to let you know everything. Her place is super nice, clean and comfortable. Plus, it smells very good! The room is small but super cute, clean and comfortable. Same for the bathroom. You will find guides, books, a tv and dvds in the room, and the wifi works perfectly. The neighborhood is nice, super secure, even if you come late at night, and it's only five minutes by foot. Finally, Michelle has a wonderful cat, absolutely lovely and adorable. She will let you alone if you don't want her near you, but if you like cats, she will always be ready for a scratch behind her ears and a loud purr! In a nutshell, I would go back to Michelle's place without any hesitation!",
