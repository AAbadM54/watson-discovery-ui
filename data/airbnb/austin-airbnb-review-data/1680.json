  "text": "I absolutely loved this home.  I had two girlfriends in town and knew we would need a place that was comfortable, not too big and design-worthy.  Well, this house fit the bill precisely!\r\n\r\nAnna's home is well appointed with stylish furniture, modern appliances and the most luxurious tub.  It's cute 1950's on the outside, 2012 on the inside.\r\n\r\nIt rained almost the entire weekend so I was disappointed we couldn't use the outside area which was huge and nicely manicured.\r\n\r\nI would gladly rent again and plan to tell everyone I can about the wonderful weekend we had.\r\n\r\nThank you, Anna!",
