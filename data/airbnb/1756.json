  "text": "The Casa SoCo experience was perfect! I was down in Austin with 4 coworkers immediately following SXSW and Ash was able to turn the house around for us and get us settled and comfortable for our stay from the previous tenants in no time flat. She's incredibly communicative and the layout and instructions for the house are clear and super helpful. The neighborhood is amazing, space and layout of the house is bigger than expected and the entire stay was comfortably and homey. Stay here if in Austin!",
