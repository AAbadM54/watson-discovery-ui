  "text": "Cool Airstream. The bed is on the opposite side of the trailer where the A/C unit is so if you're someone who likes airflow it can be a problem, but it was cool enough and my wife and I were comfy. Guest house situation is nice enough, met other Airbnb guests who were staying in that house, which was kind of fun.",
