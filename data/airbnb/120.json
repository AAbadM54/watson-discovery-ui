  "text": "Never met Susan, but communicating with her was super easy by text/call. Her instructions for everything were clear. My room was clean and comfortable. The first floor rooms are separately constructed so there is some noise that easily passes through, but everyone try's to keep the noise level down after 10pm. The R and N trains are about half a mile walk. The B70 bus is just around the block.",
