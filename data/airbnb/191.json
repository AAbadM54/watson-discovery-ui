  "text": "Robert's place was great! Perfect size and location. The subway is right beside the apartment, so getting around was insanely convenient! Plenty of food spots right around as well-which were also very nicely laid out in the little manual Robert leaves for his guests. Thank you! We loved the apartment and our stay in Brooklyn! Biggie in the window is also pretty cool! ;)",
