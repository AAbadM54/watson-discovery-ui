  "text": "What an awesome place to stay in Austin!  Blaine and his roommate Marissa are just rad people. I came in for a conference and didn't know anyone in town, hanging with them on my time off was definitely a highlight of the trip. Both also had great suggestions for places to check out in town. The room is comfy and there's a nice selection of vinyl, if you're into indie. \n\nTravel tip: Austin kinda sucks without a car. This spot is SUPER close to downtown and it's easy to get wherever you need to go via bus or Uber, but once you're in town the public transpo leaves a little something to be desired. Both Blaine and Marissa gave me rides when they were available which was SO sweet. Really awesome peeps and I'd totally stay with them again!",
