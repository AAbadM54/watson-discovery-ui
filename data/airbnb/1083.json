  "text": "Robin and Mike were amazing hosts, very friendly, and great to chat with.  The bed in the room was comfortable, and they provided toiletries in the bathroom just down the hall from the room.  They even fixed up their bikes to let us borrow them (although we did not get an opportunity to ride).  The location is easy walking to South Congress, lots of restaurants, interesting shops, etc.  We were able to walk to 6th street for music/bars one night there was nice weather (not short walk, but doable).  The only items to note are the room is not that large, but it works great for two people sleeping comfortably; and the bathroom near the room only has a bathtub (but Robin and Mike offered us the option to use the shower upstairs).  Overall super friendly people, made us feel welcome to hang out in their home, they gave great restaurant recommendations, very comfortable atmosphere and personalities (they even made a beer run for us).  We would stay there again in the future!  The cat Rufus was one of the highlights of the stay, great personality for a cat!",
