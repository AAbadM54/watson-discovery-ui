  "text": "My friends and I were in a wedding in Austin and found Melissa's house as an alternative to the hotel option and it was amazing. She was easy to communicate with before and during our stay, and was very accommodating when our plans changed slightly (more guests than originally expected). The house was absolutely stunning (the pictures don't do it justice) - we all wanted to stay longer. It is an ideal place for a large group of people. We were running around doing a lot of wedding stuff so didn't get nearly enough time to enjoy it - but we were already talking about coming back next year. Definitely request this place!",
