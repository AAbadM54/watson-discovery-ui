  "text": "Staying in Rene & Thomas's airstream was so amazing. It was more than we could have imagined ourselves and it came equipped with everything we might have needed for a weekend away. The location was on point - easy access to everything and all areas of Austin we might have wanted to explore. The interiors and detailed touches of the airstream only added to the wonderful experience - making it more fun. They were fun, inviting, laid back & homey hosts which made us feel as if we were friends just popping in for the weekend. A highly recommended stay.",
