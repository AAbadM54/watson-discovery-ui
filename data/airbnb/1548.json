  "text": "Sandy was a wonderful host and her guest house is very clean, comfortable, and charming. She was extremely responsive and made sure I felt right at home. The place has a spacious yard with lots of shade which is great for relaxing outdoors in the Texas heat. It's in a great location in South Austin and is well-appointed with a full kitchen and washer and dryer. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again if the need arises. Highly recommended.",
