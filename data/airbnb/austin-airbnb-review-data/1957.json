  "text": "Emily's adorable home was truly comfy and wonderful!  Very easy to feel right at home there.  I was in Austin on business and so glad I found her place!  All modern upgrades, great bed & shower, lots of windows, wonderful backyard with a big deck and located in a really cute and classic Austin neighborhood... I would definitely stay there again.  Emily was very informative and helpful on preparing for the stay as well as easy to communicate with via text for random questions during.",
