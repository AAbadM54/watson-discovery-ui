  "text": "This was hands down the most immaculately prepared Airbnb I have ever stayed in. Barbara pays attention to ever detail from the house manual to fresh jugs of water in every room upon arrival. Her home is beautiful, spacious and loved. The back yard is a playground with the swinging rope into the pool to the jacuzzi and grill. Can't wait to book again! - highly recommended.",
