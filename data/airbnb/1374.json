  "text": "Initially, this place looked really cute (especially in the photos) however once we got in we realized it wasn't as cozy as we expected.\r\n\r\nA few things:\r\n\r\n1. This place does NOT have two beds, only one. My BFF & I had to share the full size bed (luckily we've done it before) however we were expecting two beds like the listing says. This place would NOT accommodate four, two is plenty -that is, if you're both willing to sleep in a full size bed (which I haven't done in years)\r\n\r\n2. The shower is nothing like you would expect in a place labeled a \"retreat\" - the water pressure is weird and kind of just drips on you. Also, there were only 2 towels provided to 2 girls staying 3 nights - it worked out, but a second set would have been a nice touch.\r\n\r\n3. The trash was not changed prior to our arrival and the place was not as clean as I thought it could have been prior to having guests (us). \r\n\r\n4. There was a French Press on the counter however when opened, we discovered dirties in it. We never did find coffee, so I don't know if it was provided or not (I'm thinking not) \r\n\r\nThe price we paid AFTER being refunded some of our monies due to a pest issue was an appropriate amount of $$ to pay for this place, however I don't think I'd stay here again. To Sydney's defense, she was super duper nice and easy to deal with!",
