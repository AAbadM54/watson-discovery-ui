  "text": "Robin & Mike were great. Super laid-back and accommodating. We didn't use the kitchen much, but it was fully equipped with whatever we needed. The location is really close to anything you could need- grocery store, restaurants, parks, move theatre, downtown. The room was comfortable and quiet, and the bed was super comfy. It was raining the majority of our stay, so we didn't get to explore the backyard- but it looked great! The bathroom was a great size and the shower head was wonderful. Great claw foot run for baths. Great room for anyone that wants a place to stay close to the action!",
