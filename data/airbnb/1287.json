  "text": "Amazing modern house right near the heart of downtown Austin. Stayed at Brennen's place with my co-workers for the SXSW music conference.  Tons of great food options and multiple bike rental kiosks near by, which allowed us to get anywhere we wanted in minutes. Everything about this place is state of the art. Very comfortable.\r\n\r\nBrennen was very accommodating and addressed and took care of concerns almost immediately after I reached out to him. Everything relating to the transaction and logistics went super smooth. I would highly recommend this place to any group looking to have an awesome time in Austin. Hope to stay again soon!",
