  "text": "Sue rocks and her condo is awesome! This was our first time in Austin and this was the best place to stay to get to know the city. Her condo was in the perfect location, right on 6th street and in walking distance to east Austin bars and restaurants and downtown 6th street area, plus a short Uber to South Congress. We felt like we were right in the middle of everything we wanted to do. The place was super clean and comfortable for 3 of us, and Sue made us feel at home by leaving us plenty of snacks, waters and a pack of beer for the weekend. She was very available for questions throughout the weekend, and gave us a ton of suggestions and information about Austin for the weekend. I'd definitely recommend her place to anyone visiting Austin and would stay again! Also, check in/out process was a breeze.",
