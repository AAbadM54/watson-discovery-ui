  "text": "My friends and I stayed at CasaSoCo for a Bachelorette Weekend.  We spent the first hour at the house talking about how cute it is and how much we loved it!  There was plenty for room for eating, hanging out, and sleeping.  Great parking space as well for our three cars.  The kitchen was well stocked.  We took the bikes out Saturday to Barton Springs Pool and had a blast.  This is a great place and Ashley is fantastic (she even stopped by!!).",
