  "text": "Staying with Robin and Mike was the perfect start to our 2 week road trip round Texas. The house is in a very cool area with lots of restaurants/boutique stores really nearby. The room was clean, had a super comfy bed and a great private bathroom. Robin and Mike are fantastic hosts, very interesting people with lots of great advice to make sure you get the most from Austin and keep things weird!",
