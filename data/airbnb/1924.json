  "text": "The stay at Brett's place was extremely comfortable!  The unit was spacious, nicely furnished, and outfitted with nice appliances/fixtures.  We really liked the balcony. \r\n\r\nThe neighborhood is quiet and close (by taxi/uber/lift) to all the places in Austin you might want to visit.  I would say that walking from downtown back up the hill to the apartment is a bit of grind so would definitely recommend taking a cab.  All in all, I would definitely stay here again!",
