  "text": "We had a terrific stay in the apartment! Our reservation was 25 nights and we loved everything about it. The apartment is less than a minute away from the subway, and the bedroom is very big. It was described accurately, as it is a little older and cozy, but we did not mind at all. It could have been a little cleaner, but that did not detract from our stay. The host is incredibly friendly and always available to answer any questions that I had. Overall, it is a great find for the cost, and we had a lovely time in the apartment. We would love to stay here again",
