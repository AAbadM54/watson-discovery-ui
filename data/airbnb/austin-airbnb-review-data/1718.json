  "text": "We had an amazing time here in Austin and Anna's house was perfect. It's adorable, comfortable and well-stocked and there's tons of outdoor space in the back. The neighborhood is nice, safe, and quiet, and it's just a quick 10/15 min cab ride to downtown. During our stay there was an issue with the water (100% outside of Anna's control) and she was extremely responsive and helpful. I would definitely stay here again!",
