  "text": "Anna's home is absolutely adorable. The interior of the house is very cozy and chic, and the backyard is huge and perfect for coffee on the deck or a meal at their large outdoor table. Hyde Park is just a hop, skip and jump away, and downtown is a 10 to 15 minute drive. If you're looking for a warm and very Austin two-bedroom place a bit removed from downtown, this is the house for you. Also, Anna is very quick to respond and provides you all the information you need prior to arriving. I would highly recommend this place.",
