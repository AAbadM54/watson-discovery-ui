  "text": "Tri and housemate Jon were absolutely wonderful/friendly/funny hosts. The room is clean, neat and comfortable as is the whole house. The location is quite and suburban but still very close to anywhere you need to go (I walked a lot and Uber were always cheap if needed.) They were very generous with their time and local knowledge helping me with my questions about Austin cafes etc. Definitely recommend staying here, it has everything you need, is in a great location and great guys. :)",
