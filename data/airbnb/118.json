  "text": "I really enjoyed my stay at Clara's house. It was comfortable, cute and really well located - a short walk from the subway which was super convenient! Clara was very accommodating and inviting. She gave great directions and suggestions,  like Astor Row Coffee, which was close by, for getting some work done. She also mentioned that there will soon be a cafe in her building. The Corner Social restaurant was also really close by. I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in NYC.",
