  "text": "Wow!!  What a great first experience with airbnb.  Our host in Austin, Brett, was very thorough, responsive, and helpful.  While he wasn't in town during our visit, he provided detailed instructions and made himself very available by text message.\r\n\r\nWe loved the condo.  The decor was so cool, and it was the perfect size for a couple.  Also very clean and in a nice, homey area.  We felt very comfortable there.  Thank you Brett!",
