  "text": "Chalu was great. I booked this room very last minute (day of) and she was totally cool with it, and very accommodating. When we arrived, she was so helpful in suggesting great places to go, giving us navigation tips, and even providing a go-to list of locations and things in our room! When it came to hospitality, she was super generous. There was a mini fridge in the room that she even stocked with some beer for us! The location was perfect- just a quick drive to downtown. If I'm ever in Austin again, I would love to stay with Chalu in her happy commune!!",
