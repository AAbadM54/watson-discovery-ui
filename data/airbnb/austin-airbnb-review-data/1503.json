  "text": "If you are looking for a quiet spot amongst the chaos in  Austin, this is the place!  House is a quick 15 min drive from the airport, and an easy 10-15 min drive to downtown either down S Congress or I-35.  \r\n\r\nOur large group was looking for a spot to call home for SXSW week and Missy's house delivered on all fronts.  Quiet, spacious, big backyard, lots of beds - she even went shopping ahead of time for us, so we weren't arriving late with nothing in the fridge!\r\n\r\nCheck in and out was a breeze, and experience throughout the stay was great.  Missy checked in on us a couple times to make sure we were doing alright.  We arrived and were greeted with a fire in the fire pit and all beds made and ready for us.  \r\n\r\nCould not rate this spot any higher - I hope to stay there again some time when I'm visiting Austin with a big group.  This house RULES.",
