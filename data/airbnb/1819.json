  "text": "Jon and Carley were great to rent from. I did not meet them but had let them know earlier when I would be arriving. I believe I checked in around 5/6pm on a Sunday. The instructions to get into the place were very simple. The only problem I had was my google maps accidentally told me to make a turn when I just needed to go straight down into the driveway. The location is adorable. Very private and close to downtown. The house itself is a cute older home. I've lived in Oregon before so the home reminded me of older homes you could find in Oregon. They had instructions inside as well that were clear to me. I did not spend much time in the house. I did take advantage with my dog of the trails and huge park areas near the river. There is a trail access right down the street which was great. There are lots of food places nearby and a grocery store too. The location is close to DT like it states in the description. The home is a little older but I enjoyed every minute. There are a ton of books around too. However if you are kind of picky and expect brand spankin new and modern remodeling this unique home isn't for you. If you love quaint places and are respectful and understanding of a home pretty much in a woods like surrounding then this is a fun place. I did find a little bug on the bed, but I scooped him up and let him out. The place was nostalgic so I enjoyed it!",
