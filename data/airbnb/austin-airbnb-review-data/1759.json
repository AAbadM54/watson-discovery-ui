  "text": "We had a great time staying at Casa SoCo. Ashley was very accommodating and a great host. The bikes were a great asset. The location can't really be beat. We were able to walk to South Congress and 1st Street easily and enjoy the great shops and restaurants. Great for families with young kids too. The recommendations for activities and food were great as well and very helpful.",
