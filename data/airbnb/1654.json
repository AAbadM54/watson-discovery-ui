  "text": "I stayed at the Sparrow House for about five weeks and my experience was nothing short of amazing! The house quickly felt like home, comfortable yet sophisticated with gorgeous interior design running through every inch of the home. The backyard is reason enough to stay! It is a perfect place to relax, enjoy a meal, or host a few friends. Ayn was the perfect host. She was always incredibly responsive to my needs. We had a wind storm that did some small damage to the backyard and Ayn made sure it was repaired and cleaned up within a couple short days. The location is great; I felt like I was close to everything in town. I will definitely be returning to the Sparrow House if I ever find myself in Austin again! Thanks so much for your hospitality Ayn!",
