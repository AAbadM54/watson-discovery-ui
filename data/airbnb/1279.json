  "text": "We had a great stay in Austin! The weather was quite intense and many of our plans shifted but Tri was always responsive and easily accessible when communicating or coordinating. He even lent us a raincoat which was greatly appreciated.\r\nHe made us feel comfortable and welcomed in his home. Location is great, close to University and short Uber ride into downtown Austin. We would stay again in a heartbeat!!!",
