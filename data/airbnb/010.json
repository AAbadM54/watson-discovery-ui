  "text": "My experience at Robin's place has been incredibly fun and exciting. The house is welcoming and Robin is always ready to help, if needed. Strategic position, really close to the up and coming Bushwick neighborhood, full of new restaurants and bars, and just a few stops from the more famous Williamsburg. It takes 20' to get to Manhattan. I stayed for 20 days, I needed somewhere that was fun and safe while I started working and had to look for an apartment for the rest of my stay in the city, and Robin's place was just perfect. Every day, very diverse and interesting people come and go from the apartment, and you will always have a chance to chat and hang out with others. If you have a chance, book this place,",
