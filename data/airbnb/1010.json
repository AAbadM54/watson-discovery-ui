  "text": "In the cutest neighborhood you will find this bungalow. There were four of us and we all agreed it was charming and clean. Perfectly located (close enough yet far enough). Also something that was important to us was the safety of the neighborhood and it was perfect and very quiet. I would stay here again!",
