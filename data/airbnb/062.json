  "text": "Will and Joe are awesome hosts and really fun guys to live with. They were very accomodating and welcoming, making me feel at home from the moment I got there until I left. The apartment itself was great. Located at the end of a quiet street made sleeping really easy. The room has plenty of storage space for clothes and suitcases, and the bed was really comfy. I definitely recommend staying with Will and Joe.",
