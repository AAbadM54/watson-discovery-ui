  "text": "The apartment was great. Definitely centrally located and close to anything you would want to see in central Austin. We visited quite a few local food trucks. \r\nBrett's place officially gets the most comfortable bed award on our two week trip! The apartment has a little bit of everything you need. Brett was quick to answer and available if we needed anything.",
