  "text": "I stayed at this house with 6 other friends of mine and had a blast staying here.  Located walking distance from South Congress, the neighborhood was quiet and activities were only a couple of blocks or a short cab ride away.\r\n\r\nThe house has so many wonderfully Austin-y quirks about it, some even subtly suggesting places you might want to visit while in town (for instance, the coasters on the kitchen island had pictures of Austin staples like Amy's Ice Cream, Hut's Hamburgers, etc.)  Even the bathroom's reading material had some personality!\r\n\r\nAshley personalized the greetings inside the house upon arrival and also left some treats in the fridge!  There were several binders left on the table with information about places to go nearby as well as how everything worked within the house.\r\n\r\nAlthough we didn't get to use many of the cool amenities outside, the house was extremely cozy at night and the beds were great to crash on.  This is a great place to stay with a large group of friends as it comfortably fit all 7 of us.  I absolutely recommend staying here if you need to house a large group!",
