  "text": "Stayed here for a weekend in March 2015 and really enjoyed it.  There's a lot of neat artwork/decor throughout the space yet it still had a very comfortable feel.  It's a short bike ride from downtown but there's also a lot of great food and entertainment options nearby. Courtney was out of town, but she provided me with lots of good info (places to eat, best streets to bike on, etc.) through our communications. The bikes were lots of fun; I took it all on some neat trails as well as through downtown - really a great way to see Austin. I'm hoping to stay here again when I eventually make it back to Austin.",
