  "text": "The host was very thoughtful and responsive to our needs. I rented the condo for a bachelorette party and he made sure to include things around the house to make our event/trip more memorable. The condo was very nice and he included lots of amenities so that we didn't have to pack them and bring them with us. The condo is right next to the pool which was amazing and we used constantly throughout our stay. We also walked the short distance to the river and went paddle boarding/kayaking one day. The condo is only a short ten minute uber ride to downtown.",
