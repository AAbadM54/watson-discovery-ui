  "text": "We absolutely loved our time at Anna's bungalow in Austin. Well located, everything you could possibly need and just gorgeous decor! We could not have asked for a better place to spend our four days in Austin visiting my sister over Thanksgiving. Communication from Anna was great and the whole process was very easy for us being new to Airbnb.\r\nHighly recommend for anyone looking to stay in Austin. Will definitely stay again if we ever make it back!",
