  "text": "Anna's house was PERFECT! Comfortable, clean, beautiful backyard with a grill that we completely took advantage of, fully stocked kitchen, and washer and dryer to boot! The location was great too! Central so we were able to get everywhere we needed to go quickly and also very nearby many cool and delicious restaurants/bars. My husband and I are displaced Austinites so we knew this was going to be a great location but to anyone new to Austin whose looking for a great place to stay, I highly recommend Anna's house! She's great to work with too! Very easy to contact should there be a need!",
