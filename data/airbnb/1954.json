  "text": "I'd highly recommend Kyle's place.  It was just as described, clean and close to all Austin has to offer.  We were in town for ACL and it was a quick ~10-15 min Uber ride away from Zilker Park.  Kyle's place is also walking distance from shops, restaurants and a grocery store.  He checked in several times to make sure we had everything we needed and was very accommodating!",
