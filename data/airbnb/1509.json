  "text": "My family and friends had an absolutely amazing time in Austin celebrating my birthday at this retreat home!  Our stay at the retreat was perfect in every way and exceeded our groups expectations.  The photos and description of the property are 100% accurate, and are even more beautiful in person! I coordinated the accommodations for our trip of 8 people to Austin, and everyone was in awe at how beautiful and perfect the property was for our needs.  The retreat home is very well located, in a quiet neighborhood approx. 15 mins to downtown Austin. The home and private studio on the property was comfortable, spacious, clean, tastefully decorated and well-stocked with basic needs such as towels, sheets, etc.  The beds were comfortable and there was ample closet/drawer space for our clothes.  We thoroughly enjoyed the outdoor space where we were able to grill on the BBQ pit, and then eat dinner on the outside deck.  \r\n\r\nCommunication with the host was excellent and replies to messages was always prompt.  Detailed, thorough and easy to follow instructions were provided regarding check-in/check-out.\r\n \r\nMy birthday at this S. Austin retreat was one that I will never forget! We could not have asked for anything better!!  I would highly recommend this property for any group looking to have a fun time in Austin!",
