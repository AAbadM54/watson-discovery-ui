  "text": "Brett was organized, considerate, hospitable, thoughtful, cheerful and responded immediately whenever I called with a question.  The apartment was just perfect.  It's  like living in a luxury tree house.  Everything you want to do is right outside your door in the city but it was quiet and clean and in a beautiful old neighborhood.  I hope to always stay in this apartment whenever I visit my young adult daughters.  And sweet Brett is now a friend as well.  The whole experience was positive and wonderful.  Feeling blessed.",
