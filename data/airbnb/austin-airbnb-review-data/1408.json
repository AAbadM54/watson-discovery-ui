  "text": "Stayed in Conor's Cat Lady Suite for 3 nights and am glad I did! Even though I was incredibly tired upon my arrival, Conor and some of the other guests convinced me to go two-stepping in the evening. Conor showed us some amazing spots down town and ensured we were having a good time. Conor's recommendations of places to go to were all spot on. It was easy to get into town from his place by bus and the house was clean and comfortable. Thanks for everything, Conor!",
