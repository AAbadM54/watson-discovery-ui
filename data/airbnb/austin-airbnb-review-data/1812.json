  "text": "It's just as described. It's rustic but everything worked. Laundry, lights, a/c, and etc. it's quiet but you do hear noise from nearby highways during rush hours. Wasn't a big deal for me. Overall I enjoyed my stay and the host answered all of my questions promptly. Uber is everywhere so going to downtown was so easy.",
