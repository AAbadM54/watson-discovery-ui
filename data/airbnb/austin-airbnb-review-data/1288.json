  "text": "Pam was a wonderful host. We were new to Airbnb and I was nervous to be staying in someone's house I didn't know. She made us feel extremely comfortable and went above and beyond. She even dropped us off at the ACL Festival and picked us up. Her home was very cute clean and in a great part of Austin. Her dog Harley was extremely sweet. If you want a great experience look no further. Thanks again!",
