  "text": "Dallas was a great host and our whole team enjoyed our stay. His place was very nice and well-kept, as the photos illustrated. Dallas also provided some complimentary food, coffee, beer, and toiletries that was very appreciated. He was quick to reply to any quick questions via e-mail or text, and even came over promptly to help us figure out a question we had about the house. Would definitely suggest the place and Dallas as a host to anyone, and we would rent from him again next time we're in Austin!",
