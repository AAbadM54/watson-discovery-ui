  "text": "Awesome airstream!! Went for a relaxing girls weekend and got exactly that. We fell in love with the airstream and the very vintage feel that it gives off. The ceiling panel with changing lights was perfect for laying on the bed unwinding listening to the vintage radio with a station only Austin can offer. We absolutely loved it!",
