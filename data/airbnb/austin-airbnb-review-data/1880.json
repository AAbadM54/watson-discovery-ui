  "text": "This house really was stunning! We had a group of 9 and Jill was incredibly accommodating, even with a couple of last minute questions and requests. It was the perfect way to spend time with old friends. The house was clean and comfortable, I slept like a baby, and we'll definitely call Jill next time we're in town.",
