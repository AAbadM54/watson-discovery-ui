  "text": "Ayn was a very responsive, accomodating and kind host. Our 1st reservation was cancelled on us and we are so happy it was because this was a great place for us! Her Sparrow House is clean, funky and cozy. This is a prime location, central to everything in town. Our son was getting married and we hosted a Family Dessert Party Wedding Eve here. This house, with it's cute backyard patio, was the perfect spot to meet all our new family members! There is no parking on this busy street here, so if you have more than 2 cars, guests will need to park a block or 2 away. We highly recommend staying here!",
