  "text": "My friends and I loved our stay at Anna's home. The photos were very accurate - the house was well-appointed, well-stocked and very clean. She had a very easy check in/check out process and all communication was clear leading up to our stay.\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood was very convenient. We walked to lunch one day at Workhorse and grabbed coffee at Epoch on our way out to explore Austin. It was also centrally located to all that we wanted to do in town.\r\n\r\nI would wholeheartedly recommend a stay here!",
