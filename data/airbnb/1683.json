  "text": "I highly recommend Anna's bungalow! It was the perfect retreat for my family's visit. I live in Austin but we are in the middle of renovating our home. My sister & cousin decided to come visit on short notice and I couldn't (and didn't want) to say no. Anna to the rescue! With barely 24 hours notice, we were able to secure her bungalow. The house is centrally located but tucked away in a quiet neighborhood. Very peaceful! The home is decorated beautifully and the kitchen was equipped with everything we needed, including champagne/wine glasses that passed my sister's approval (and she's very fussy about her stemware!) . We hope to have the chance to stay here again!",
