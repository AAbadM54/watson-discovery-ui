  "text": "AUSTIN\r\n\r\nI had a great time at your wonderful Airstream. It had everything I needed to have to get work done and sleep a table to do computer work/check e-mails on and a bed to sleep. Everything was comfortable and relaxing. October in Austin was a nice time to attend a conference (between ACL weekends and not SXSW).\r\n\r\nRene and Thomas made it easy for me to get into the Airstream even though my arrival time changed a bit.\r\n\r\nIt's far enough out of the city to be relaxing and still close enough to be downtown in about 15 minutes.\r\n\r\nI would stay here a again next time I'm in Austin.",
