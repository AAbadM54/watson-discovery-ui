  "text": "This house was excellent! Very clean and nicely decorated, my family enjoyed it immensely! The back yard was fabulous to have bbq one night with the provided grill, and the location is excellent and central to most of Austin's entertainment, campus, and downtown. Highly recommended and Anna was super helpful providing all of the information in a timely fashion.",
