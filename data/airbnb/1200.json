  "text": "My wife and I really enjoyed our stay in this vintage airstream camper. While it's not downtown Austin it is certainly easy to get to and in a very nice and quiet neighborhood. The airstream is well decorated and very clean. There is no bathroom in the airstream (which would have been nice) but there is one in the adjacent house with easy access. There is a nice backyard that you can relax and enjoy the evening if staying in for the night.",
