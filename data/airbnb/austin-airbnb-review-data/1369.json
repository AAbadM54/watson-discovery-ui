  "text": "Everything about this apartment and location is ideal! I would stay here again every time I visit Austin. It's beautifully decorated, the kitchen is stocked with all the right tools for cooking, very comfortable bed and an air mattress in the living room. I was more than thrilled with the accommodations! The location is walking distance to shops, restaurants to the main downtown area and a wonderful walking trail.",
