  "text": "Our group of 10 stayed at Melissa's wonderful home this past weekend for  a brief reunion in Austin.  It was perfect: 15 minutes from downtown and the airport.  The back patio and yard was a perfect place for us to hang out and catch up.  The home had everything we needed and we could not have been more happy with our stay! Would definitely come back in the future.",
