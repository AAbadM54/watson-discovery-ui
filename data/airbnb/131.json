There are all things you need for comfortable staying.\r\n\r\nApartments located at quiet street close to subway station and supermarket. We were at January and it was no problem with heat or hot water.\r\n\r\nMick was very friendly and helpful, he digged out us after snowfall :)\r\n\r\nWe recommend stay at Mick's apartments.",
