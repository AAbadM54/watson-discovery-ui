  "text": "First and Foremost:  Melissa could not have been more accommodating, attentive and engaged.  She worked diligently to ensure our trip was perfect.  She was very prompt and responsive throughout the entire process.  Melissa was an absolute pleasure to work with. (This type of care and service is rare to find) She definitely went the extra mile to ensure the house was ready fro us.  \r\n\r\nAs for their home:  It could not have been more perfect.  We had a group of ten and slept comfortably.  The entire property was decorated uniquely and had a warm-welcoming ambiance. It was clear that a lot of thought, hard work and craft-skill has gone into this home.  It has a unique vibe that, for lack of a better term, can only be describes as modern and crafty.     \r\n\r\nOutdoors:  Tons of space to relax and enjoy, including a fire pit, BBQ pit and yard games.  There was also a private studio-suite out back, and plenty of parking.  We spent a lot of time outside enjoying ourselves and grilling.\r\n\r\nOverall:  Each and every guest in our group was pleased with the home and continued to express how great, perfect and cool it was.  It is a perfect place for a big family, a few couples or even a quiet getaway for two.  I, along with several others in the group, will most definitely choose Melissa and her home next time I'm headed back to Austin.  I don't think I could be more impressed or pleased with the entire process.  Melissa and their home was PERFECT!",
