  "text": "Carol has been a great host, from the beginning to the end! The private room was clean (and also the rest of the apartment), well-organised and exactly how it is described on the picture. Carol had prepared some guidelines about what I should visit in NYC and a cleaning set (toothbrush, toothpaste, skincare cream, towels, etc.). Unfortunately, I did not have that much time to speak with Carol because I was 90% of the time out, visiting the city. But when I spoke with her, she was always very nice and helpful! Carol definitely knows how to receive visitors and I would recommend her place if you are looking for a calm and nice place in North Manhattan. I hope I could come back to her place next time I visit NYC because I really felt like home when I was there!",
