  "text": "Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Rene & Thomas's \"agave ranch\"! The winds stream was a dream with plenty of room and great atmosphere. My boyfriend and I came to. Austin for the ACL festival and our hosts were gracious enough to leave us a hand made survival kit, it came in handy! Only regret was that we couldn't stay longer, we will definitely be booking here again next time we head to Austin. Thanks guys!",
