  "text": "Julie's cloud palace was a wonderful place to stay for Valentines Day. She was flexible with our check-in time, and check-in was quick and easy. Julie was a wonderful host, she even left us some goodies to enjoy upon our arrival. The space itself was clean and very cozy. The bed was as dreamy and comfy as could be. The neighborhood was extremely convenient as well, only a $8 uber to 6th! Overall, I would definitely recommend.",
