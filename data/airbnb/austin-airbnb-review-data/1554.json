  "text": "The house was kept very clean with fresh linens and towels laid out for us. Brandon and G'Nell even left travel-sized toiletries out for guests. The neighborhood was a nice quiet area about 15 minutes away from Austin itself and very easy to get to from the airport.\r\n\r\nThe house was very roomy and the decor was quite nice as well, all-in-all I would highly recommend it.",
