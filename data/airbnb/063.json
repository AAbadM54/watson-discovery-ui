  "text": "Best Airbnb experience so far! Irnalba is very hospital and we feel like home during the short stay. She put up an extra bed for my dad and is very considerate of all our needs. The  room is clean, warm and cozy. Peaceful neighborhood. Little hard to find street parking but Irnalba kindly offered us their spot! Very pleasant stay!",
