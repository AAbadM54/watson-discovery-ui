  "text": "This place was fantastic.  Pictures are accurate, however the place actually feels even better.  In a very safe and quiet neighborhood, a 5 minute drive to fine restuarants (or bars) on the river, 10+ easy minutes to downtown (except in rush hour).  We had two couples and an adult daughter so the three bedroom/2.5 bath was great.  Very clean and well-appointed (new appliances including wine cooler, washer/dryer).  If the description looks good for you, you'll really like it.  Highly recommended (and the airbnb staff were excellent when we had a question about internet access - fixed in 3 minutes!).",
