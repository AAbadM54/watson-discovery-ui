  "text": "Great experience. The place looks just like the photos, but has an even cozier more welcoming feel to it.\r\n\r\nI loved the fresh water carafes and set of plush robes in every room : )\r\n\r\nWelcome bottle of wine was very much appreciated after a day of travel and Ashley was kind enough to allow us a late check out to accommodate our later departing flight.\r\n\r\nI would absolutely stay here again!",
