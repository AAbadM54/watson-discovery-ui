  "text": "The Cloud Palace is very well titled - we consider ourselves fortunate to have had the chance to stay there for nine great nights whilst in Austin.  \r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood is peaceful yet has enough locally to keep the traveller fed and amused.  Julie made some very helpful suggestions in the Guide Book (and even by text when it became obvious that we hadn't read it) on where to go in the neighbourhood.  Transport into the University and town was really easy and convenient (although it's not a long walk).  \r\n\r\nThe Cloud Palace appears exactly as it is described and the bed is ridiculously comfortable! Julie has a great eye for detail and the furnishings and decor gave the place a true Texan feel.  Julie was such a fantastic host who not only accommodated us on very short notice but greeted us with wine and chocolate. \r\n\r\nWe would highly recommend the Cloud Palace!",
