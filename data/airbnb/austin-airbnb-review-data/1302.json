  "text": "Julie and her place are simply beyond compare. She went out of her way for a last minute booking, left wine and chocolate as welcome gift, and offered neighborhood guidance and city exploration advice all along the way. She's down to earth, well traveled, and carries a quick laugh that will slice through any jet lag. The place itself is full of charm, from a Berkey water filter to wood art, vintage towel hooks, and poetry on display. Everything from the furniture to the shower products to the beautiful bed are perfect choices and will leave you rested and smiling. 5 stars. Thanks, Julie!",
