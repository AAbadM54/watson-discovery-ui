  "text": "We arrived late and called Rene for clarification about how to get into the house. She picked up after one ring! When we got into the yard, we saw the trailer all lit up. Once we got inside, we discovered that the radio and space heater were on as well, ready for our arrival. The Airstream was even cuter than it looked in the photos. We were worried that having the bathroom inside the main house might be awkward, but it was very private. We never even saw the other people that were staying in the house. Overall it was a completely romantic evening for us--felt like camping in a friend's backyard!",
