  "text": "The first day I came Kevin greeted me at the apartment and showed me around. The place was exactly like the pictures on the page. I was alone so there was plenty of space for me. The door is tricky, so I had to ask Mike for help when I got back my first night. This apartment is on the third floor, so unless you're packing lightly, be prepared to do some heavy lifting because there's no elevator. Lol. Because the bed is in the living room you'll see other guests crossing through to go to bathroom or coming in/leaving, which wasn't a problem for me because I'm a sound sleeper. It's a good walking distance from Central Park. They have a list of places to go, which I was only able to do half of during my stay, and a list of restaurants. Even though a lot of the main places I wanted to see weren't  close, luckily the closest subway for very convenient in getting me around. Since they're both students, the only times I ever encountered them was when they came in to prepare for the next guests. Both guys are very cool and welcoming. I highly recommend booking with them!",
