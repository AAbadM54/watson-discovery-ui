  "text": "This is an excellent location for anyone visiting Austin. Super bike friendly and close to everything. We were out there with our cycling team for an event and it housed us very well. Everything is pretty much straight up and we never met our Host which is fine because the instructions were pretty clear. I Definatey recommend this spot for anyone that is visiting.",
