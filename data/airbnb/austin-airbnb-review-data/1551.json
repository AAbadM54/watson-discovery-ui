  "text": "This is a lovely home. Brandon and his wife made our stay comfortable and easy to navigate, there was plenty of space for kids and dog and three adults, who were so harried when we arrived that we pitched the kids out the door and took long naps on luxurious beds. The kids ran wild, and enjoyed the neighborhood which is only partially developed. I took my dog on long walks every morning through the same empty lots which function as a green belt -- an unexpected bonus.\r\n\r\nThe house is light-filled and airy, the architecture is fun -- I couldn't have asked for a better vacation home. Concrete floors, roomy showers, a generous dining room and kitchen -- the lower level is open-plan and set up perfectly for entertaining. Each bedroom has its own bathroom. \r\n\r\nI would not hesitate to stay here again -- thanks, y'all!",
