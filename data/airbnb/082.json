  "text": "The apartment was exactly what we expected from the listing.  Perfect location for our needs -close to the 6 and L lines.  Rachelle was prompt with all email communication.  The key pick-up and drop-off was a great system that allowed you to not have to meet somebody at an exact time. We will definitely book again here.",
