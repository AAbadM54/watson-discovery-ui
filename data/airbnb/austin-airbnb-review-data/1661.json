  "text": "The Sparrow House was such a great place to stay. From the really awesome decor, to the great outdoor patio, the house was luxury with a twist of chic design.  The place was really clean and our host took very good care of us leaving yummy welcome gifts :)  \r\n\r\nI would definitely go back and recommend this location. Very close to S. Congress and Downtown, just a car ride away.",
