  "text": "Joe's house was fantastic.  Four stories filled with cozy beds, a jukebox, a pinball machine and a rooftop vista and projector?  Thanks, Joe.  It's in a great part of town and is super convenient to get around.  He welcomed us with chips, salsa and beer.  There's a garage in the first floor, so parking is included too.  No complaints.  5-stars.  Would stay again. A++.",
