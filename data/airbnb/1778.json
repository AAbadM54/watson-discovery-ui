  "text": "Walking into this house was such a breath of fresh air. Ashley has created a wonderful, inviting, and charming! space. She's really thought of everything, amenities-wise, and had such a cozy spot absolutely PERFECT for 8 people. We're already talking about coming back.\r\n\r\nThe location is also wonderful, sandwiched between S 1st st full of cute restaurants and S Congress, which has a TON of shops, restaurants, etc. Both within walking distance. And definitely bikable w the bikes she has for you!!!\r\n\r\nI would highly recommend this house for larger groups.",
