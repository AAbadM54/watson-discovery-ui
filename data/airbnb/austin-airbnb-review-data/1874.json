  "text": "Blaine was easy to reach before a and during my stay! He was accommodating about my late arrival and he and his roommate were welcoming when I did arrive. His home is beautiful and the private room and shared bathroom were clean and comfortable! I will definitely recommend this home to others and look forward to the opportunity to stay again! (This home is a close drive to the Austin Prometric testing center and several good coffee shops, I stayed while I was taking board exams. If you need a place to relax before or during your testing days, this is it!!)",
