  "text": "Kaan is a super nice host who will chat with you a little bit also leave you your privacy. He has a super cute dog and his apartment is kept very clean and tidy. The room is small but feels spacious still with some vanity space with a mirror and seat and a big bed. He leaves an iPad for you to browse. Super great host and place for the price and location! Would book again!",
