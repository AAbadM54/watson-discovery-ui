  "text": "Ashley was a fantastic host and was very willing to answer questions and make us feel welcome. The house was great for our group of 8 guys and fit everyone comfortably. The grill and fire pit were a huge plus, but the biggest draw was the proximity to South Congress and South 1st. Both were easy walks and the neighborhood had a lot to offer.",
