  "text": "I really enjoyed my stay at Linda's place. It was my first time in Texas and I felt really comfortable. She was very clear and concise with any instructions and always offered breakfast. She even offered a ride to the airport! Next time I visit Austin and need a place to stay, I hope I can stay at Linda's again.",
