  "text": "A beautiful home, it was wonderful to stay here! Everything was perfect: plenty of space, a lovely back garden & front porch, clean, cozy, nice wood floors, a true home away from home. I would happily stay here again & recommend it to friends. Kyle always answered questions quickly but really we didn't need to ask much since everything was taken care of.",
