  "text": "Dallas -- Your house is wonderful. It had all the space we needed and was beautifully furnished. There were plenty of sheets and towels and the big TVs were popular.  As we left, my cousins and I talked about how perfect it was for our stay in Austin. An extra \"bonus\" was the iron and ironing board -- which we used as we got ready to attend the wedding. Although I did not realize it at the time I made the reservation, the location was excellent. In addition to being very close to major highways, it is convenient to the airport, and turned out to be very near one of the family parties we attended. Thank you so much for our home away from home. Best regards, Susan",
