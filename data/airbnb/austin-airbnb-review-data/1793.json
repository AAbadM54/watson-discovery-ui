  "text": "It's a lovely place. Everything was just perfect. We got a few friends over BBQ and it almost felt that I lived in Austin! Kitchen was stocked with herbs and spices, Nescafe Pods, all required utensils - what else can you ask?\r\n\r\nErica is pretty awesome - very responsive and helpful.\r\n\r\nThe place is in a great neighborhood - safe, quite, and very close to the lake.\r\n\r\nWhen I'm back in Austin, I'd definitely come back here.",
