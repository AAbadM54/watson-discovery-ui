  "text": "Alyson was a generous and fantastic host and beyond accommodating. She had dinner party plans on our first night and offered to move us into a more private room to make sure that we would be comfortable. Communication was extremely smooth, and she did everything possible to ensure that we enjoyed our stay. On top of that, the home is beautiful and has a very peaceful and relaxing energy. We really enjoyed hanging out in the sun room. I would love to come back and would recommend the Lotus House to anyone!",
