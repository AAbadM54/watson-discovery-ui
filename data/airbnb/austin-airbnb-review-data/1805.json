  "text": "Barbara made us feel very welcome in her home and it was everything as advertised and much more!  My family was very comfortable and enjoyed the beautifully decorated house and backyard where there was plenty of room for everyone to spread out and visit.  The kitchen was perfect and her extra effort to provide an island for our sandwich making extravaganza for wedding party nearby was most helpful. We will be back!",
