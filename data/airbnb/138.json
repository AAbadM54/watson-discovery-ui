  "text": "The trip started off well enough, Rafael wrote us stating where the keys were.  The first apartment at 2C had no reception for the internet so they graciously moved us to 4B.  2C is right above the front entrance so we woke up every night to loud music and talking.  4B was better, it had a Roku which was great.  But the apartment is heavily infested with cockroaches.  Afterward moving out, Rafael accused us of \"trashing\" the apartment and that we caused him to \"lose a month's rent\" because of the apartment's condition and we would have to pay them $800.  Pretty clear that these guys are scam artists who are trying to get a little more money from tenants.  This has been a very negative experience for us.  Make sure you take pictures of the apartment before you leave in case they come after you!!!",
