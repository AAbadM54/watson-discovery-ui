  "text": "Joe came to welcome my friend to his place and walk her through the house. \r\nI didn't meet Joe in person but my friend mentioned that he was really nice, making her feel welcomed.\r\n\r\nI would say that Joe's place look even better than the pictures. The kitchen is super open, spacious, and with great appliances. We didn't cook there but I imagine it must be so amazing to cook or grill a steak there. Only by standing in the kitchen would make you feel like a professional chef, haha.\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed the pieces that Joe put together. He has a unique taste, but we were amazed by how the pieces fit so well to the place.\r\n\r\nThe best part for us was the rooftop. It was spacious with a projector TV and nice sound system. The couches are super giant and comfy. We were all very tired; otherwise, it should be a fun place to hang out and have some drinks.\r\n\r\nAll in all, it was a great experience. I highly recommend anyone to stay at his place!!!",
