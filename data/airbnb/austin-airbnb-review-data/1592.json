  "text": "Dallas' house is perfectly located.  Very easy to access both downtown and the F1 circuit (why I was there), and close to stores, but wonderfully quiet, on a small estate, and near to a lovely park area.\r\n\r\nNote: pool / spa are unheated!  We were rather hoping to use them but Austin weather was definitely not cooperating.\r\n\r\nBeds are very comfortable, lots of clean towels and dish rags.  Good sized kitchen.  Whole place was clean.  Kitchen could do with a few more utensils - no strainer, for example (that I could find) - but overall has everything you need.\r\n\r\nGuest bedroom had a curtain rod that was not affixed and fell down easily, not ideal after long work days.  Apparently this was an improvement upon zero curtains prior to arrival, but would have hoped for secured curtains (and also a bedside light) for the amount of $$ paid for the rental.  This was noted to Dallas and I'm sure will not be an issue for the next rental.\r\n\r\nThe wifi / router went down - major issue, given we were there for work.  Dallas was extremely available and communicative via email and, despite being out of town and only flying in that night, we had a new router as soon as he touched down.  Very impressive.\r\n\r\nI would recommend both this property and renting from Dallas.",
