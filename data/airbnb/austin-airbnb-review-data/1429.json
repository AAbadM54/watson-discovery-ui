  "text": "Alyson is a lovely, warm host and we very much enjoyed our stay at the lotus house. Her place is just as pictured- serene, peaceful and clean in a beautiful and convenient area of Austin. I especially appreciated how easily Alyson accommodated our need to stay an extra day in the area, although it was a last minute decision. I would highly recommend her home for other airbnbers and would definitely stay with Alyson again next time I'm in Austin.",
