  "text": "Ashley was a fantastic host.  She shared a lot of information about the house in advance, which made arrival stress-free.  The binders she has in the home are full of lots of helpful information on the area -- the restaurant and food truck recommendations are fantastic.  \r\nThe home is very comfortable to spend time in, and also well-located to explore Austin.  Our group of 7 women had a fantastic time.",
