  "text": "The listing is very accurate with pictures of rooms that have not been altered. Ayn & Sebastian were in touch throughout & answered all our questions & attended to all our needs. We would highly recommend this house. Our family was in town for a wedding (2 couples & a single) and we were very comfortable despite having concerns abt 1 bathroom. With all the space for hanging out & lounging it was perfect. We even had a little get-together at the end of our stay so that the local couple could see how lovely it was. Everyone was very impressed.",
