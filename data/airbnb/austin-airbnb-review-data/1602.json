  "text": "Dallas' townhouse was spacious and clean, and a very comfortable base for our stay in Austin. He was extremely responsive and overall a great host. He made sure our stay was comfortable and that we had everything we needed. The house was a perfect distance from the city center and the airport, so it was easy to get around. Recommended!",
