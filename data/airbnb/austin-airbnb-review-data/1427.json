  "text": "Alyson has created a haven of relaxation - I could barely pull myself away from her home, to go to SxSW, the ostensible reason for my visit to Austin.  The cycle ride along the Lady Bird Trail is an immersion in nature - yet what a great way to get to downtown and the South By venues. In the evenings sitting on the sun porch watching the sun go down was one of the highlights of my stay.",
