  "text": "We had a good time with our one night in Austin. This place has the vibe of an artist studio that doubles as a house. Great location. It is located in a cute quiet old neighborhood only a minute from the busy downtown area. Very close to bat bridge. We did a bike ride to the bridge but be warned there are very steep hills you have overcome to get there. The place has a unique funky Austin feel. The house is comfy and our party of 6 had plenty of space. \nOnly have a one complaint that there was basically no toilet paper in the house which was not a good thing to discover in the middle of the night while feeling sick :( However I accept part of the blame due to our very very (less than an hour) short notice of reservation and arrival. I would stay here again. \nTrey was a great host. We booked the place less than an hour before our arrival and he was very accommodating. We were one bike short for our group and he had one we could use. We also had a flat bike tire upon arrival and he brought us an air pump. Overall a great experience",
