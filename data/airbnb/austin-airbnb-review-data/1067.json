  "text": "I could not have been more pleased with my stay at the Cozy Treehouse.  Courtney was not in town, but she was very welcoming and responsive to all my questions. She had already prepared a list of restaurants, grocery stores and other places of interest that she e-mailed & left in the apartment. I referred to it constantly and was so impressed by how conveniently located this apt is to everything by car and walking/biking if you are in the mood. The apartment looks exactly like the photos, but they do not do it justice. It is perfect for one person. I found it very easy to work there (I was here on business for approx 12 days) and relax too as the balcony is fun and the bed is an amazing magic marshmallow (I wanted to take it with me).  Highly recommended to people who want a comfortable and convenient place to stay in Austin.",
