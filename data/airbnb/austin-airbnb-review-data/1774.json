  "text": "What a lovely home!  I hosted a girls' weekend in Austin, and couldn't have picked a better place to stay.  The location was great (a short walk to a lot of great restaurants and shops), the home was adorably designed and well stocked with anything we needed.  We had a few reasons to reach out to Ashley over the weekend, and she was always very prompt to respond and help out.  I would definitely return!",
