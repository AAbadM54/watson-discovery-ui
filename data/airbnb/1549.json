  "text": "What a GREAT place! I highly recommend it for anyone visiting Austin. A spacious 1 BR layout (PLUS a nice loft) with a full, new kitchen and W/D so you can relax, cook, clean, up, spread out - whatever you need to in Austin. The host is super easy to work with, extremely hospitable, and on-the-ball communication wise. I think everything was BETTER than advertised. Book this spot for your next Austin getaway, work trip, or any other reason you'll be in town.",
