  "text": "Conor! Conor was a fantastic host and quite the eclectic dynamic weird (in all of the best ways possible) dude you would ever hope in a host at a hostel in Austin! Super attentive and accommodating fella, the place was super clean, towels and sheets and mattresses and all. We had a rockin good experience and time! And he'll sit you down with a map and give you the down low on Austin and all of his personal recommendations which were spot on. Yup! If you're looking for a hostel experience that is unique and fun and overall a rip roarin good time Conor is your man!",
