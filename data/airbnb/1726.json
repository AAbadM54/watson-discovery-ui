  "text": "The neighborhood is fun, quiet and convenient. The host was fast and responsive if I had any questions. \r\nSuch a cute little house!  Our family of for rented this home so we could enjoy a long weekend in Austin.  It was a great location for us to do all of the things we love to do while in Austin, as well as convenient to all of our family and friends in town. We live in Houston and most of our family and friends are in Austin. On the last night we hosted a BBQ for family and friends, the back yard was such a great setting!",
