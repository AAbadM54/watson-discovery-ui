  "text": "This was my first airbnb experience.  I will definitely make this my first call the next time i go to Austin.  The location was essentially perfect - less than 10mins by car to Downtown Austin.  My only regret is that i was so busy i didn't have much time to hang out in the Sun Room and enjoy the ambiance - but there's always the next visit.  Thank you Alyson and airbnb.\r\nG",
