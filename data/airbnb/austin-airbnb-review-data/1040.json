  "text": "We were in Austin for our daughter's wedding.  The location of the home, the ease of getting to and from the wedding venue, and, or course, the property itself all made what was a wonderful weekend, even better.  Liz met us when we arrived, gave us a tour, and made us feel very welcome. \r\n\r\nThere were five adults and two children in our party, and we were all comfortable in the home's extensive living spaces.  The courtyard was an added bonus, since the kids could safely entertain themselves there while we were completing last minute wedding preparations.  The on-line picture of the back room does not do it justice!  It was a welcome, and very comfortable, place to catch a quick nap, watch a bit of television, or just enjoy the quiet.  \r\n\r\nThank you, Liz, for sharing your home.  For years to come, I'm sure we will all fondly recall the memories we made in  our \"wedding house.\"",
