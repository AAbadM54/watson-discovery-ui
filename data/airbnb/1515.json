  "text": "The house was an amazing place to host my sister's Bachelorette weekend. We had 12 girls stay at the house and everyone fit comfortably. The house was clean, beds had clean sheets and everything was exactly as I expected. Melissa was a pleasure to work with leading up to the weekend to make sure that our stay met our expectations and that all of our questions were answered. We had a wonderful time and would definitely stay here again!",
