  "text": "Me and my family loved Anna's bungalow. It is cozy, clean, efficient, warm (we were there during winter holidays) and charged with very good energy. \r\nMy parents enjoyed the patio, the yard and the porch with a cup of coffee every morning. It was so nice to cook there, the kitchen is well equipped. I loved the tableware. \r\nThe good vibe of this place was part of the great experience of our holiday.\r\nWe recommend this house and are looking forward to stay there again.",
