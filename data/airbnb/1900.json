  "text": "Brett was amazing. Everything was very specific in the guidebook for how to access things in the condo. It was very clean and looked exactly as the pictures described. Brett was a great host in that any time we texted him with a question about Austin or the apartment he responded within minutes. Definitely the perfect place to stay if you're visiting Austin!",
