  "text": "My friend and I had a wonderful stay in Ms. Sarah's humble abode during SXSW. I highly recommend her and Airbnb. For the same price, if not less than Motel 6 (which was 2-3x the normal price due to the festival) we had the opportunity to stay in a very \"Austin-esque\" apartment. It was great to be able to retire in a homey, mellow space after a long day/night. She is very courteous and gave us our full privacy for the entire stay. Thanks!",
