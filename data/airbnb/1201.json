  "text": "Despite trying to vacation in Austin during 'floodmaggedon' I had a really nice stay in the airstream. You can tell they put some thought in for people that would be staying there which was refreshing. I felt really comfortable going and coming as I pleased and didnt feel i was intruding any of the other guest in the house when i needed to use the restroom,shower, or kitchen. \r\n\r\nIf i get a chance to revenge my trip I would stay here (website hidden) - they also checked in on me multiple times during flash flood warnings and tornado warnings, that should say enough about the type of people they are.",
