  "text": "This was my first experience with not only Airbnb but any kind of host situation. It was a great experience. Martin was very kind & patient while I was navigating through the process. Once I arrived he was very warm, engaging and made sure I had everything I needed to be comfortable!  The furniture & furnishings were very comfortable. I enjoyed it much more than the traditional hotel experience and look forward to using this resource & Martin as a host again in the future!",
