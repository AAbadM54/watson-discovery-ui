  "text": "The house was located in a very safe, quaint neighborhood, within walking distance to some local restaurants and a CVS. The house itself was very well kept with a large kitchen, a spacious, open floor plan and beautiful hardwood floors throughout. The bedroom was also beautiful with a large, comfy bed and plenty of natural light from the large windows facing out on the front porch. There was also a large backyard, equipped with a hammock and some chairs to kickback in and enjoy the Austin sun. Wes was very nice and welcoming and even wrote out a list of must-see places around Austin, tailored to my specific likes and interests. I would definitely recommend this airbnb to anyone looking for a nice place to stay in Austin, TX.",
