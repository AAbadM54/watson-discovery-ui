  "text": "My stay with Linda was great, she accepted my request although I messaged her extremely late as I got into town later than anticipated. Linda is so accommodating, welcoming, great spirited, and just a pleasure to talk to with so much knowledge. The house is beautiful, homey, very large and in a great location. I would definitely stay again next time I am in Austin.",
