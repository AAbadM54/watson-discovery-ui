  "text": "Mariah from the beginning was a communicative host and her room was as described. The apartment was nothing special but we booked it for one night since we were in town purely for a concert and needed somewhere to stay. \r\nMariah, \r\n\r\nAt 3:10 in the morning we were awoken with a banging on the door by a male screaming to be let in, which proceeded until 3:50 AM. We weren't notified during this time, or before, that we should: be expecting company, not lock the privacy lock, or the other room was booked. We simply thought someone was trying to break in and rob us, so I had to call the police that night. My girlfriend was distressed because of this whole ordeal and I couldn't go back to sleep, so we ended up leaving as soon as we could in the morning!\r\nThis is nothing personal and the communication that we had in the beginning of the booking process was perfect, but our stay and trip was marred by this experience.\r\n\r\nWhen people book with AirBnb this is the one thing they hope to avoid yet somehow it happened to us and we never received a sincere apology. I wouldn't recommend this listing or AirBnb after this experience. \r\n\r\nAustin",
