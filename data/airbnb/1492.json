  "text": "Joe's  home is fantastic! Beautifully decorated, very spacious (even more-so than the pictures look) and located very close to the center of downtown. There is a pool and hot tub right in the middle of the complex- great to cool off in the Austin heat. The juke box was the perfect touch. Highly recommend staying here!",
