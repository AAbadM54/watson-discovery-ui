  "text": "We had a great experoence thanks to Joseph's place. It is only a couple blocks from Columbus circle, the subway, and Lincoln Center. Grocery, 24 hour good diner, CVS all at end of the block, plus Maison Kayser bakery and many eateries nearby. Very comfortable layout and most basics. We ate breakfasts in the cozy dining area. Would suggest turning the heat down in the winter (we cracked windows open), having extra TP on hand, a couple of wash cloths in the bathroom. The smaller bedroom mattress needs to be turned as it dips on outer half. Would recommend to others!",
