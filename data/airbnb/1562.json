  "text": "This place is amazing, we went for vacations to Austin and everything was great. The house is bigger than it looks, it was clean, spacious, in a nice neighborhood, we were 6 and we slept very comfortable. It is also very close to downtown, like 5 min. driving. Dallas and his friend Blue were very nice to us, they recommended places to visit in town and they gave us a pack of beer in the fridge. We are definitely coming back some other day.",
