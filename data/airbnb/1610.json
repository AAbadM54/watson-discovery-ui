  "text": "Dallas was a perfect host!  He provided all of the information we needed right up from and responded to question throughout our stay immediately.  His place was just what we hoped, with 2 king bedrooms, an open queen bed loft and still room for socializing.  We had 8 people stay at the house, one used an extra mattress provided by Dallas in one of the King rooms, one slept on the couch (but not because there weren't other air mattresses!), and the other six slept two to a bed.  The neighborhood was very close to downtown, where we went out each night, and also near great neighborhoods like SoCo, Rainey Street, and Town Lake (where we paddle boarded, only a 5 min drive from the house).  Cabs and Uber were easy to use to and from the house.  The pool was a relief after a long and busy weekend on Sunday.  Dallas even provided coffee and filters which we greatly appreciated each morning!!  I'd 100% recommend this place and am grateful for such an easy stay as I celebrated my 30th birthday with out of town friends from out of town!",
