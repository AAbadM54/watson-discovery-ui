  "text": "Our company needed a place to host a hackfest for our development team. The house was great, and gave us the space we needed to brainstorm, work, eat and sleep for the week. Dallas was an amazing host. He made sure we had everything we needed for the week, and he was very accessible throughout the process. When we had special requests, he did his best to provide what we needed quickly. Our event was a success, and Dallas made sure things went smoothly for us.",
