  "text": "My wife and I absolutely loved the stay at the Airstream. We mentioned it was her birthday and they went the extra mile to buy her a cupcake and wrote a note saying Happy birthday so she loved it. She also completely fell in love with the airstream. We never saw the host but they provided everything we would need. South Congress is right down the street too, which is where we spent a majority of our time. It was an amazing stay and we would definitely stay again.",
