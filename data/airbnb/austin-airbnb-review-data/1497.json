  "text": "Mike & Yolanda were very accommodating and quick to respond to our request. The neighborhood had a great vibe, as did their home. I felt like they were open to hang out if we wanted to, but they also let us have our space, which was perfect for us. They offered filtered water & coffee, clean towels, and a great bed. That bed was very, VERY comfortable. We were travelling with our dog, which is normally a bit of a hassle, but they were very easygoing about it. Also, the backyard there is great! We fully enjoyed the hammock. \r\n\r\nThanks you 2!",
