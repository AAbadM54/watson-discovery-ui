  "text": "Evan immediately got us in touch with his roommate, Mike, upon booking the reservation, as he was going to be away for the weekend. Mike was our main point of contact all weekend, and he was extremely helpful, flexible, and kind. The room was actually bigger than expected, and the bed was very comfortable. I would highly recommend Evan's place to anyone looking to stay in the neighborhood!",
