  "text": "Nothing but good things to say about Blaine and his place. Blaine was responsive and clear as far as communications went. He was flexible about our late check-in, which made managing our itinerary MUCH easier.\r\n\r\nThe place itself is simple, clean, and close to everywhere we needed to be. Most importantly, Blaine and his roommate were not completely awkward and actually pretty normal! Mostly hands off (which is great) but definitely funny and engaging when they had to be. Try to get to know Rufus, the dog. Awesome, but misunderstood.",
