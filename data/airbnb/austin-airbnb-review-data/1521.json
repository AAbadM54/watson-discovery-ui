  "text": "I rented this property for my son's graduation from UT. Everybody enjoyed the house, inside and out. The accommodations were perfectly clean, the decoration is beautiful, and the back yard is one of a kind. Melissa was very friendly from day one and kept in touch just in case we needed anything, which we did not since everything was great. Would definitely recommend for family reunions.",
