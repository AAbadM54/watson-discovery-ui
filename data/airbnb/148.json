  "text": "Ed and Heather's place was perfect for me. I stayed for six nights and it was clean, cozy and the bed was super comfortable. It's close to everything you could possibly need including a delicious Italian restaurant right next door. Heather was a responsive host and she made me feel very welcome. It's really got a great Brooklyn vibe to it and the price for the quality is unbeatable. Thanks again!",
