  "text": "This was my first Airbnb experience and we were very impressed. My boyfriend and I stayed 1 night just to get out of town. The place is awesome! It's the perfect location (close to downtown) and is very clean and well kept. We felt very safe which is a huge factor to me.  It's definitely a better alternative than a hotel. It looks exactly like the picturesâ€¦ No guessing at all! This may be our new go-to place when we go back to ATX!",
