  "text": "I stayed with friends at Dalla's apartment in Austin for a long weekend. The place is spacious and really comfortable for a big group (we were 6). We also got to enjoy the pool, which made our stay so much more enjoyable. The condo is located 10 minutes by car from tons of bars, cafes, restaurants and stores. There's also free parking in his garage. Dallas was very easy to communicate with, we found the close in amazing conditions and would be happy to go back to Austin and stay there again.",
