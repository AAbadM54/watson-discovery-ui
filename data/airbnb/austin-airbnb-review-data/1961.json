  "text": "We had a great stay an Emily's during our visit to SXSW 2014.  The house is a very nice bungalow in a safe neighborhood quite close to downtown. We rented bicycles and it was only a 15 min ride from downtown. We stayed with three single travellers, so one of us had to sleep on the airbed in the living room, but that proved to be no problem. The hose was clean, well-kept and very comfortable. Emily gave us an efficient introduction to the workings of the house and left us a binder with all kinds of useful information. She even left us a basket with all kinds of snacks, which we appreciated greatly! Sadly the weather was quite cold, so we couldn't spend much time on the lovely porches, something we'd really looked forward to. Luckily there are lots of nice coffee places and shops in walking distance. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Austin.",
