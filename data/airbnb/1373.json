  "text": "Sydney was a great host! Very welcoming. Her apartment is in a great location - very close to fun restaurants/bars and Lady Bird Lake trails. We had a car with us, and luckily were able to use her visitor pass to park in the lot right outside. \r\n\r\nWe were in Austin during some of the major storms/flooding, and Sydney was very sweet to check in with us to make sure everything was OK. She was always responsive if we had any questions.\r\n\r\nThe only minor thing was that there were 3 of us staying there instead of 2, so there weren't enough towels/sheets. But otherwise her place comfortably fits 3!",
