  "text": "This house was PERFECT for a girl's weekend in Austin! It truly felt like home away from home and we all could enjoy meals/hanging out together in one place.  The rooms are spacious and beds are comfortable, we loved the outdoor dining space as well.  Ashley was very on top of things - quick to answer our questions and provided great local information about the neighborhood. The house is on a quiet street - walkable to South Congress/South First or a quick (5-10 min) Uber/cab ride to downtown. I strongly recommend staying here!",
