  "text": "My husband and I stayed at this wonderful home for 2 nights. It's situated in a fantastic neighborhood near lots of shops and eateries. Robin and Mike are very hospitable and friendly, and were able to give us recommendations for where to go around the city. \n\nThe bedroom has a private bathroom but it doesn't have a shower so you use theirs upstairs which is a bit awkward. The bedroom is also situated next to the living room and since the hosts are often home, it doesn't always feel too private. \n\nThe home is extremely clean and beautifully decorated. Bed is very comfortable and we loved the neighborhood. Best of all the resident cat, Rufus, who seems more like a doggie, will win your heart over with his loud purrs and friendly disposition. Overall it was a good stay.",
