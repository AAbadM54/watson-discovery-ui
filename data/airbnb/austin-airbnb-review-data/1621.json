  "text": "Dallas made us feel welcome by checking in beforehand to make sure we were aware of how to enter the condo as well as to make sure we were having a good time during our stay. The condo is just as described and was very accommodating for the 6 of us. We had no problem getting a Lyft or Uber to the location of the condo and everything we wanted to see was no more than 15 minutes away. I would definitely stay here again!",
