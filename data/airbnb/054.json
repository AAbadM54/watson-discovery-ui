  "text": "This was a very pleasant experience for me.  Mine was a long term stay and Isabella made it very easy for me to move in and move out and was helpful along the way.  My plans were still constantly changing, and as they changed Isabella was flexible and accommodating.  If and when I had an issue that needed her, she was in touch and helped me find solutions.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBottom line, the apartment is appropriately listed.  The East Village is a bustling little area of Manhattan with some of the best food options, cultural experiences, and people you can find.  Frankly I pleasantly surprised how much I came to love the East Village and Lower East Side, having had little exposure to the area previously.  It is littered with some delicious local eateries, trendy coffee spots, and hidden shopping.  Not to mention that Union Square is just a few avenues over.  If you are big into the New York City night life, this is a pretty ideal situation for you.  The neighborhood is compromised of an overall younger crowd.  So, there are a lot of trendy bars and clubs all over including some of the city's most well-known places.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe apartment itself is a cozy one-bedroom studio with a useable kitchen and bathroom.  I am not a very good cook, but I would not recommend trying to cook a gourmet meal in the kitchen.  Regardless, it is suitable for anyone looking to whip something up at the end of the day.  It is not suitable for having a lot of people over, though it is comfortable for a few friends.  The washing machine and dryer are perfectly functional and made laundry a breeze.  Everything else ��� the dishwasher, sinks, refrigerator, shower, etc. ��� all work well and required little to no work to keep them up and running.  As far as furniture goes, the apartment features a comfortable couch in the living room and a nice bed.  Isabella has nice taste and prioritizes comfort.  Perhaps the best aspect is the back deck, where you can get a little fresh air and relax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe apartment is in good range of public transit for Brooklyn and the rest of Manhattan.  As an employee here in the city, I had little to no problem getting myself to and from work and meetings all across the city.  If Uber is more your speed, cars are always everywhere in the area and arrive immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe building as a whole is also great, perhaps even a little undersold.  It is a quiet spot with good neighbors.  The apartment features a camera doorman that lets you see who is trying to buzz in.  It is obviously helpful if you have ordered food or what not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll in all, Isabella was a great host with an honesty first policy.  She has not oversold the apartment and made my visit as easy as it was pleasant.  If you are looking for a longer term stay I would recommend her highly.",
