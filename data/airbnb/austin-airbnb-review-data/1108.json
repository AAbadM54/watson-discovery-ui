  "text": "Robin and Mike are wonderful hosts. They were very welcoming and courteous. The room was perfect, and exactly as listed. While I was rather busy during my stay, I appreciated their invitations to things and suggestions for things to check out. \r\n\r\nTheir place is located in a vibrant neighborhood, within walking distance of so many great places to get a sense of Austin's culture. Anyone looking to explore, or even rediscover Austin should consider staying with them on their next visit!",
