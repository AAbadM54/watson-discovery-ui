  "text": "tri was really responsive and took care of us even though we had a 2am flight landing to AUS leaving towels and the key for us. the room was as advertised - bed, lamp and clean sheets. he and his roomie were really nice, offered suggestions and checked in with us frequently. \r\n\r\nthe listing is in a convenient location: $20-25 from the airport and less than $10 to go downtown via uber. \r\n\r\ni would recommend staying with tri if you want accommodations that are simple with a nice host :)",
