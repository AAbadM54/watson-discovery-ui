  "text": "Came to Austin for health treatments. Anna was very gracious and helpful. I have chemical sensitivities and she did her best to help cut down on my exposures. Had an issue w/ the front door, she got fixed right away. Her home was nicely done, mattress comfy, neighborhood quiet & great coffee place nearby. The location is convenient to central market and my treatment office. I hope to stay again.",
