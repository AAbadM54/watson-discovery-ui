  "text": "This was our first Airbnb experience, and it was great! We weren't able to meet Jonathan and Carley, but they were fast to reach out to us with instructions for getting into the house and left little notes around the house answering our questions before we even asked them. The house was perfect for what we needed, and it was a quick drive to a lot of great places to visit in Austin. All in all, great experience.",
