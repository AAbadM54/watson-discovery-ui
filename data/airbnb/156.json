  "text": "I loved Karl's place! This was my 4th Air BnB, and my favorite so far. Nicely decorated, great-smelling, extremely clean, huge king-sized bed smothered in pillows, lovely plants & plenty of cooking supplies (french press, garlic press). The apartment is also extremely quiet even though it's on Newkirk Ave (it's high up & set back from the street). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI also love this nabe -- coffee shops, laundy, the Q/B train, & groceries all extremely nearby (within a couple blocks). A short walk to restaurants, more grocery stores, & a health food store on Cortelyou. Cafe Tibet is delicious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI didn't meet Karl in person, but he was extremely responsive and helpful before and throughout the stay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would love to stay here again & strongly recommend!",
