  "text": "My friends and I stayed at Ayn's to celebrate my friend's upcoming marriage. It was an amazing trip. Ayn's home is beautiful - she clearly has great taste. The checkin process was smooth, the house was in a great location, we had a rental car and were minutes from everywhere we wanted to be (downtown, Barton Springs, South Congress). The backyard is an absolute dream and we spent many evenings just relaxing and enjoying the setting. Also, the shower is so much more than a shower, its like a SPA! Thank you so much!",
