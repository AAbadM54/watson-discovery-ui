  "text": "This is a charming house, very typical of the style of most older homes in that area.  (My parents live a block away, so I know the neighborhood well.)  It's set up with an access code, so that getting in is very easy.  All the supplies I needed were there.  It's a short walk to Jo's Coffee and countless other attractions in SoCo, but the house itself is nice and quiet.  I would definitely stay there again.",
