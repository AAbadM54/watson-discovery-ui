  "text": "Dallas' rental was perfect for four adults and two 2 year olds. The location was excellent - we rented cars but I noticed a bus stop close by if you prefer public transit. Dallas was available via text for any questions and it's close to the airport! What else can i say, if you're visiting Austin go with Dallas's rental!",
