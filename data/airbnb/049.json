  "text": "Cathy was the perfect host! She was flexible and accommodating to changes in our travel time, and welcomed us with a bottle of wine, chocolate and lots of useful information about the neighborhood. The apartment is beautiful, brightly lit and extremely clean. The neighborhood is also lovely - family-friendly while also having plenty of bars, shops and trendy restaurants for younger professionals to enjoy. Also lots of wonderful groceries stores nearby for guests wanting to take advantage of the apartment's wonderful kitchen (which Cathy keeps stocked with pots, pans, utensils, etc.) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe cannot say enough nice things about Cathy and this apartment, and would not hesitate to book again!",
