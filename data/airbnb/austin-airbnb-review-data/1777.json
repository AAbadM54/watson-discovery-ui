  "text": "This place is AMAZING and Ashley was an A++ host. \r\nThe location is in the middle of where you would want to be yet on quiet street. Restaurants, shopping, music etc all within a 5 minute walk. The house was gorgeous and had every amenity anyone could ever think of and more (double patios, firepit, washer/dryer, bikes etc. Ashley was like having a private concierge regularly checking in to make sure we had what we needed and we were comfortable. I have been staying at VRBO and airbnb places for over 15 years and Ashley has been the #1 host. HIGHLY recommend!!!",
