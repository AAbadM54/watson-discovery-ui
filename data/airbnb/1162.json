  "text": "This was such a comfortable airstream! Rene had responded to our message within ten minutes and that's was so helpful because we were in a time crunch and needed a place to stay quickly! It was great to meet her and she even left us a little present :) the airstream itself is decorated so lovely with a photography theme and it takes just a little bit for the air conditioner to cool the place down. We went riding bikes and it was an awesome sight riding back up to an airstream that was lit up (LED light) very cool experience and I would definantly recommend to someone looking for a unique experience.",
