  "text": "We had a great time during our recent visit to Austin. The radio was playing when we arrived, which really set the mood. The Airstream was very clean and well-decorated. There was another couple staying in the house when we were there and they were very nice. Everything was beyond expectation and we would stay there again in a heartbeat! I would definitely recommend booking with Rene and Thomas.",
