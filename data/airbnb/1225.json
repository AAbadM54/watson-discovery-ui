  "text": "Kat was an amazing host.  Her place was nice and clean and always responded promptly to any and all questions I had.  The post was exactly what was offered when arriving.  The rental was very centrally located and almost anything we wanted to get to was at the most 10 minutes away.  Also, when the wifi wasn't working she fixed it extremely quickly with no hassel.  Would definitely recommend staying at one of her properties.",
