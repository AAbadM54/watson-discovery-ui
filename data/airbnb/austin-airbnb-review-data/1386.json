  "text": "My wife, my niece and I stayed at Linda's house for two nights last week in Austin. Linda was so kind and hospitable and made us feel at home. Her house is absolutely spotless, the rooms are comfortable. Breakfast is really fun time. While enjoying omelette, cooking ham, muffin, and orange juice together with Linda, we shared many topics! Our stay was enjoyable and we'll back again!",
