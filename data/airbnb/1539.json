  "text": "I had a great stay in Austin, much thanks to Chalu and her home.  Chalu's place is clean and comfortable.  The best part is Chalu herself.  She couldn't do enough to make my stay an excellent experience and, yet, she was never underfoot. I had all the privacy in the world, but when I needed her, she was there!",
