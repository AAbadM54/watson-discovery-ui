  "text": "Blaine was a good host. We didn't see much of each other but he and his roommate were always friendly and helpful. Rufus (his dog) is adorable. The room was clean, bed was large and comfy. Location was about a 10-15 minute drive to the downtown Austin area (will cost you around $10-$15 to Uber that distance, not bad.) The home had a really good cafe about a 5 minute walk from it (Cafe Creme) which was nice in the mornings. Neighborhood was very safe and quiet.",
