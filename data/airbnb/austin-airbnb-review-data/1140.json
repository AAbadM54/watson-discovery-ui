  "text": "I stayed here for one week with my two teenage sons who were attending a convention at the Austin convention center.\nIt was an easy 10 minute walk to the Convention center from the condo. We rented a car but found we didn't really need it so much because there are many restaurants and activities within walking distance.\nThe condo was very clean and comfortable.\nIn addition to the bedroom, there is a futon and sofa available for sleeping with bedding supplied...The bed was comfortable, futon and sofa were adequate.\nSue was a very kind and gracious host who made sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed...she even left us some snacks and a nice selection of local beers.\nOverall we were very satisfied with the experience and would stay here again.",
