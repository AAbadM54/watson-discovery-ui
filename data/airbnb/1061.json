  "text": "House is quiet, clean and has everything you'll need. It has a nice modern decor. The neighborhood is residential but close to interstate and coffee shops etc.  We stayed with our 2.5 yr old and 5 month old and had plenty of space. Alex made check in easy - he was accommodating about timing as well. we would definitely stay again.",
