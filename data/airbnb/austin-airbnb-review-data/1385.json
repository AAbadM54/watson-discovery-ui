  "text": "We stayed with Linda one night while visiting the University of Texas.  Her home is immaculate and exactly as it appears in the photos.  Linda is a lovely hostess and really made us feel at home.  She invited us to water aerobics at the YMCA.  The Y is just a mile away and is a very lovely facility; Linda's neighborhood is also pleasant and safe, and is ideal for running, walking, or taking a bike ride.  I wish we could have stayed longer and I would definitely stay again.  Thank you Linda!",
