  "text": "Sydney's place was wonderful! Location-wise, you can take a pleasant stroll down 6th street and you're in the heart of Austin in 20 minutes or so, and Lyft/taxi rides are very affordable. The bed was nice, the place was clean, and Sydney made arrival and departure seamless. The apartment is also very quiet, which is great after a long day of adventuring under the hot sun.",
