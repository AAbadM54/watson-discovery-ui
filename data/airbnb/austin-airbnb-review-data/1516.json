  "text": "Missy was an absolute pleasure to deal with and always had a thoughtful answer for my questions before, during, and after my stay. The property was even better than I expected and while poor weather hampered our ability to fully utilize the incredible backyard, lucky for us the interior of the main house was plenty comfortable for a group of 10 to hang out. I highly recommend staying here if you are looking to relax in Austin and don't mind taking an Uber to get downtown.",
