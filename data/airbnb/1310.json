  "text": "What a fabulous experience! My wife and I were in Austin celebrating our anniversary and Julie made the entire  time incredible. She had a card, chocolate, a bottle of wine, and breakfast for us upon arrival and had the place perfectly prepared for our stay. It was refreshing and better than we could have hoped. The bed is awesome and the place has a unique, cool vibe to it. I highly recommend The Cloud Palace.",
